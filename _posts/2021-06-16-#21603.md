This week, we'll look at two alternative PRs for rate-limiting logging to the disk:

- [Mitigate disk filling attacks by rate limiting LogPrintf](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21603)
- [Mitigate disk filling attacks by globally rate limiting LogPrintf](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21706)

## Notes

- Bitcoin Core can log events either to stdout or to a log file on disk (or
  both). There are [various configuration
  options](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/f66eceae/src/init/common.cpp#L63-L78)
  to control the logging, including:

  - `-debuglogfile` to specify the file to log to. Setting `-nodebuglogfile`
    disables logging to file entirely.
  - `-debug` to enable low-level debug logging. Can be specified as
    `-debug=<comma-separated list of categories>` to only log certain
    categories. Note that even with `-nodebug`, Bitcoin Core will still log
    important events to file by default.
  - `-logips`, `-logtimestamps`, `-logthreadnames`, `-logsourcelocations` and
    `-logtimemicros` all specify additional information that can be added to
    each log line.
  - `-printtoconsole` controls whether the logging is output to stdout as well
    as the log file.

- We expect most users to run with default options. For logging, that means
  that important, high-level logs will be written to file, but low-level
  debugging logs will not.

- A specific log in the code can be assigned to one of several [different
  categories](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/f66eceae/src/logging.cpp#L133-L163).
  Those categories include things like "net" for events in the networking and p2p code,
  "validation" for events in the validation code, and so on.

- We use two macros for logging:

  - `LogPrintf()` logs unconditionally (unless `-nodebuglogfile` and
    `-noprinttoconsole` are set).
  - `LogPrint()` logs if the specified category is enabled. For example,
    `LogPrint(BCLog::NET, "<log message>");` will only log if the 'net'
    category is enabled.

- One possible class of denial of service attacks is for an adversary to
  cause a victim node to repeatedly write logs to disk. This would eventually
  cause the victim's disk to fill up, and the node to fail.

- For that reason, we want the unconditional `LogPrintf()` macro to be used
  sparingly, and only in places where an attacker can't easily trigger a log
  being written.

- More generally, it would be good if there was a mechanism that could
  eliminate this entire class of potential exploits by throttling logging
  whenever it exceeds a certain rate. [Issue
  21559](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/21559) documents the potential
  exploit and suggested fix.

- PRs [21603](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21603) and
  [21706](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21706) are two alternative
  approaches. One implements rate-limiting per log location, and one implements
  rate-limiting globally. Both were implemented by the same author, who is
  seeking conceptual/approach review.

## Questions

1. Did you review the PR? [Concept ACK, approach ACK, tested ACK, or
   NACK](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#peer-review)?
   What was your review approach?

2. Macros are [generally discouraged in
   C++](https://www.stroustrup.com/bs_faq2.html#macro). Why do we use them for
   our logging routines?

3. Try enabling logging for all categories and starting Bitcoin Core (eg with
   `bitcoind -debug=all`). Is the output useful? Are there specific categories
   which generate a lot of logs?

4. The two approaches are to rate-limit logs per-location and globally. What
   are the advantages and disadvantages of those two approaches? Which do
   you think would result in more useful log output?

5. Both PRs add a new `LogPrintfWithoutRateLimiting()` macro. What is this
   used for? Why is it important?

6. Both PRs add new variables `m_bytes_dropped` and `m_messages_dropped`. How
   are these variables used? How would they be useful for a developer trying
   to debug an issue?
