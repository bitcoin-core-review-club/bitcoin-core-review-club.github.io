## Notes

* [PR 19509](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19509) is a feature PR, adding per-peer message logging to Bitcoin Core.

* Nodes on the Bitcoin network communicate using a variety of [messages](https://btcinformation.org/en/developer-reference#p2p-network).  Now these messages can be logged for easy review, in order and on a per-peer basis.

* The purpose of this feature is twofold: it should assist people in debugging their node, and it should help people who are unfamiliar with the Bitcoin network to get a feel of how everything works.

* This feature is locked behind a debug-only `-logmessages` option.  When enabled, it writes every message the node recieves to a file, in a folder structure described in the PR.  It uses our `CAutoFile` [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/ac953a3773aa5e940976a79276894f5e892d1c55/src/net.cpp#L2892).

* The log parser lives in a new folder, at `contrib/message-logging/message-logging-parser.py`.  As discussed [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19509#issuecomment-664374225) it takes a list of files to parse, and optionally an output argument.

* `LogMessage` takes the newly introduced `Span`, as discussed in a [previous PR review club](https://bitcoincore.reviews/18468).

* [This commit](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19509/commits/ac953a3773aa5e940976a79276894f5e892d1c55) accounts for the increase in file descriptor usage.  This is due to be improved in [Issue 18911](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/18911).

## Questions

1. Did you review the PR? [Concept ACK, approach ACK, tested ACK, or
   NACK](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#peer-review)?
   (You're always encouraged to put your PR review on GitHub, even after the PR has been merged.)

2. How did you test this PR?  Was setting up and running everything straightforward enough?  Reminder that the test runner has a `--nocleanup` option.

3. Did you verify that file descriptor accounting was being done correctly in [this commit](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19509/commits/ac953a3773aa5e940976a79276894f5e892d1c55)?  What is the soft file desciptor limit on your system?  What about the hard limit?  (TEMP NOTE: I'm happy to lead them into `ulimit` here in the notes, not sure where to draw the line.  Don't want people just blindly running commands)

4. [The first commit](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19509/commits/b3a0e528d1128ee456258f4b265b52b7e8fbc6a6) is a cleanup.  Is this justified or is this just noise?  When should cleanups like this be done?

5. [This commit](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19509/commits/4fc2e3906377991a05f78a938c0aa2f04056b81c) adds a test.  What is being tested?  What isn't being tested?  Should this be expanded?  Did you read the out-of-tree build discussion [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19509#discussion_r465770624)?

6. Both [jnewbery](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19509#pullrequestreview-447894982) and [practicalswift](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19509#pullrequestreview-448269477) proposed extensions to this message logging. What are they? Do you agree that these are a good idea? Are there any extensions that you would like to see?

7. Bonus: For those of you really interested in python, here's a great opportunity to explore the oddities of pathlib!  How does `Path.cwd() / Path(logpath)` always return an absolute path, even when logpath itself is already an absolute path?
(TEMP NOTE: I'm happy to remove this or move it up to notes if it's too off topic)
