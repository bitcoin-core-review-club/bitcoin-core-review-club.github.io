This is the fourth Review Club meeting on the (work in progress) implementation
of BIP 340-342.  We've previously looked at:

- [O(1) OP_IF/NOTIF/ELSE/ENDIF script implementation / Abstract out script
  execution out of VerifyWitnessProgram()](./16902)
- [Initialize PrecomputedTransactionData in CheckInputScripts and Move
  single-sig checking EvalScript code to EvalChecksig](./18401)
- [Implement Taproot signature hashing](./17977)

This week, we'll look at another commit from PR 17977 - _[Support for Schnorr
signatures and integration in
SignatureCheckers](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/commit/125318b68a)_.

## Notes

- This is the first commit from PR 17977 that uses the new functionality and interfaces
  in libsecp256k1. You may need to `make clean && ./configure && make` for the build to
  succeed.

- [_Schnorr signatures_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schnorr_signature) are a
  digital signature scheme that can be constructed over any group where the
  discrete log problem is hard. It's a different signature scheme from ECDSA,
  which is used in Bitcoin today, but there are certain similarities between the
  two schemes.

- We won't go into the construction of Schnorr signatures or the motivation for
  adding them to Bitcoin, but it'd be useful to have a high-level understanding of
  those things to motivate why we're making these changes. [BIP
  340](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0340.mediawiki) explains
  both the motivation and the construction of these signatures.

- We also won't go into the implementation of signing and verifying the
  signatures themselves. That's all hidden away inside the libsecp library. The
  [first](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/commit/94dc6bcc)
  [two](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/commit/59354a78)
  commits from PR 17977 pull in the required changes to libsecp. If you want to
  dig deeper into the implementation, [lipsecp PR
  558](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/558) is where the new
  cryptographic code is implemented.

- Instead, we're going to look at the new interface provided by libsecp for
  verifying Schnorr signatures, and how it's integrated into Bitcoin Core.

- The first thing to note about the Schnorr signature interface is that
  [pubkeys in
  BIP340](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/commit/125318b6#diff-10ed0089ccea825883e83e5afcef7697R209)
  are 32 bytes. That's unlike pubkeys in our ECDSA implementation,
  which are 33 or 65 bytes (depending on whether they're _compressed_ or
  _uncompressed_). BIP 340 public keys can be 32 bytes because the y-value
  or the point is implicit. See the **Implicit Y coordinates** and **Public Key
  Generation** sections of [BIP
  340](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0340.mediawiki) for full
  details.

- The new `XOnlyPubKey` object is the lowest-level object we'll use for signature
  validation. It's constructed with a uint256, and then the function
  `VerifySchnorr()` is called with the 32 bytes hash of the message that was
  signed (this hash can sometimes just be called the 'message', or in the case of
  signing a Bitcoin transaction the 'sighash'), and the 64 byte signature.

- The `XOnlyPubKey` object is used within a hierarchy of signature checker classes,
  which are used by the higher-level code to check signatures:

  - At the base is
    [`BaseSignatureChecker`](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/blob/125318b6/src/script/interpreter.h#L171),
    which provides three (virtual) public methods: `CheckSig()`,
    `CheckLockTime()` and `CheckSequence()`. This PR adds `CheckSchnorrSig()`.

  - Above that is
    [`GenericTransactionSignatureChecker`](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/blob/125318b6/src/script/interpreter.h#L198)
    (which is actually a template that's instantiated as
    `TransactionSignatureChecker` or `MutableTransactionSignatureChecker` depending
    on whether it's being used with a `CTransaction` or `CMutableTransaction`).
    `GenericTransactionSignatureChecker` overrides the virtual `CheckSig()` and
    `CheckSchnorrSig()` methods with implementations of signature verification.

  - And above `TransactionSignatureChecker` is a
    [`CachingTransactionSignatureChecker`](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/blob/125318b6.h#L43),
    which uses the signature cache (calling
    `CachingTransactionSignatureChecker::Verify____Signature()` more than once on
    the same transaction won't result in the same signatures being validated
    multiple times).

- The main functional changes in this PR are in
  [`GenericTransactionSignatureChecker::CheckSigSchnorr()`](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/blob/125318b6.cpp#L1550-L1569)
  and [the `CSignatureHash`
  constructor](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/blob/125318b6/src/script/sigcache.cpp#L33-L46).

## Questions

1. Why does BIP 340 use 32 byte public keys? How do we get away with not including
   the y-coordinate in the public key?

2. What other derived classes use the `BaseSignatureChecker` as their base class?

2. What is [this
   code](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/blob/125318b6/src/script/interpreter.cpp#L1558-L1564)
   doing? When do we expect a signature to be 64 bytes, and when is it 65 bytes?

3. Why do we have a signature cache? How does it help performance?

4. Why is [this
   change](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/commit/125318b68a#diff-8a3cc5f1d2678a348e95e4884d1827f1R38-R45)
   necessary?
