**Happy half-birthday to PR review club ðŸŽ‰**

## Notes

- This is a follow-up to [PR
  15141](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15141), which rewrote how DoS
  protection was handled. Previously, validation would assign DoS scores if a
  transaction or block was rejected, and pass the score back to net processing
  inside a `CValidationState` object. Net processing could then disconnect or
  ban the peer that provided the transaction or block. PR 15141 moved DoS
  handling responsibility to net processing.
- Net processing (and other components like the wallet/RPC) pass new inventory
  (transactions, blocks and headers) to validation through different function
  calls, such as:
  - [AcceptToMemoryPool()](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/4af04471695297e59fb0c855ab8fe6f6c618f8f2/src/validation.cpp#L1071)
    (_ATMP_) processes a transaction for acceptance to the memory pool.
  - [ProcessNewBlock()](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/4af04471695297e59fb0c855ab8fe6f6c618f8f2/src/validation.cpp#L3746)
    (_PNB_) processes a new block (and if it's valid, adds it to our mapBlockIndex and
    potentially adds it to the block chain).
  - [ProcessNewBlockHeaders()](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/4af04471695297e59fb0c855ab8fe6f6c618f8f2/src/validation.cpp#L3616)
    (_PNBH_) processes a vector of block headers.
- Both ATMP and PNBH have a `CValidationState&` argument. The function returns
  details about the validation of the transaction or headers in that state
  object. PNB doesn't currently take a state argument, but instead receives
  state back from PNB through the `CValidationInterface::BlockChecked()`
  callback. [PR 16279](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16279) (covered
  in [a previous PR review club](https://bitcoincore.reviews/16279.html)) would
  add that state argument to PNB.
- The `CValidationState` object was introduced in [PR
  2224](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2224), including [DoS score
  tracking](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2224/files#diff-e8db9b851adc2422aadfffca88f14c91R1881).
- This PR tidies up some loose ends left by PR 15141. Most notably it adds
  `BlockValidationState` and `TxValidationState` as derived classes of
  `ValidationState`, since the reasons that a block and transaction can be
  rejected are different.
- The important changes in this PR are in `src/consensus/validation.h`. Most of
  the other changes are updating the call sites to use the changed objects.
- This PR is much easier to review if you look at the commits individually,
  especially if you use ryanofsky's review tip in the [PR
  description](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15921#issue-274447642).

## Meeting Log

{% irc %}
13:00 <@jnewbery> hi!
13:00 < kanzure> hi
13:00 < diogoser1io> hello!
13:00 < amiti> hi
13:00 < fjahr> hi
13:00 < lightlike> hi
13:01 <@jnewbery> Today's PR is 15921. Notes and questions are in the usual place: https://bitcoincore.reviews/15921.html
13:01 <@jnewbery> Thanks to everyone who reviewed/tested/left comments!
13:01 <@jnewbery> the PR was merged today, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't review it
13:01 < schmidty> hola
13:02 <@jnewbery> In my mind, there are (at least) three reasons to review PRs:
13:02 <@jnewbery> 1. Make suggestions to the PR author on how to improve the PR
13:02 <@jnewbery> 2. Leave your ACK if you think the code should be merged or your NACK if you think it shouldn't be
13:02 <@jnewbery> 3. Learn about the code
13:03 <@jnewbery> All three are still valuable after the PR has been merged
13:03 <@jnewbery> (1) can lead to follow-up PRs that can improve the code further, for (2) you might still find a bug that other reviewers have missed, and we should all be doing (3) all the time!
13:04 <@jnewbery> ok, any initial thoughts about the PR?
13:04 <@jnewbery> (as always, question 1 is Did you review the PR? Concept ACK, approach ACK, tested ACK, or NACK? (Donâ€™t forget to put your PR review on GitHub.)
13:05 < amiti> I thought it was interesting to review. Since it touched all the sites that care about block / txn validation, it exposed me to new parts of the codebase
13:06 < fjahr> Yeah, I acked since it makes a lot of sense to me to separate Tx and Block validation
13:06 <@jnewbery> amiti: good! The PR title says this is a tidy-up, but I thought it might be interesting because it touches the net_processing-validation interface, which I think are the two most interesting components in Bitcoin Core
13:07 <@jnewbery> fjahr: good
13:07 <@jnewbery> ok, for those that reviewed: what steps did you take to review/test?
13:08 < ajonas> Going through each commit was a must on this one. And ryanofsky's suggestion was very helpful on the first commit.
13:09 < amiti> I mostly just read the code one commit at a time & tried to understand the changes, and poke around the larger codebase to get context for them
13:10 < lightlike> just looked at each line of code that was changed and tried to understand it (saw the hint by ryanofski too late)
13:10 <@jnewbery> yeah, ryanofsky's reviewer tip was very helpful
13:10 < michaelfolkson> Agreed <ajonas> I'd like more of those reviewer tips
13:10 <@jnewbery> lightlike: perhaps I should have added the tip to the commit log?
13:11 <@jnewbery> next question: Does this PR change any behaviour, or is it a pure refactor?
13:11 < lightlike> jnewbery: no, it was clear enough in the first post of the PR, just my fault...
13:13 < michaelfolkson> #15141 changed behavior but this one (#15921) didn't right?
13:13 < fjahr> I did not see any behaviour change. It was consensus code after all :)
13:13 <@jnewbery> Did anyone here review the previous PR (15141)? If not, did any of you go back and look at it?
13:14 < lightlike> it does change an error message of sendtransaction rpc call in case of missing inputs, other than that I didn't see anything.
13:14 <@jnewbery> lightlike: good catch!
13:14 < michaelfolkson> I looked at #15141. I didn't "review" as already merged
13:14 < amiti> I def took a look at 15141 in the context of this PR, but didnt dig very deep
13:14 <@jnewbery> yes, some minor logging/error message change
13:15 <@jnewbery> michaelfolkson: yes, 15141 has some minor behaviour changes in the way we ban/disconnect peers
13:17 < michaelfolkson> That punishment logic was interesting
13:17 < michaelfolkson> But leave that to later, let's stay on #15921 for now ;)
13:18 <@jnewbery> michaelfolkson: yeah, the disconnect logic is very interesting
13:18 <@jnewbery> which leads us into the next question: Why do you think we have different validation results for RECENT_CONSENSUS_CHANGE and CONSENSUS?
13:19 < michaelfolkson> I initially thought it was SegWit related but it actually wasn't
13:19 <@jnewbery> well segwit was the last consensus change
13:19 < michaelfolkson> For a future soft fork/consensus change right?
13:19 < fjahr> I found that RECENT_CONSENSUS_CHANGE relates to everything after segwit
13:19 < fjahr> so it has not been used yet
13:20 < amiti> I didn't understand why thats already been introduced if its not used yet
13:20 < fjahr> but it would be used to prevent a potential network split
13:20 < amiti> fjahr: how so?
13:21 < lightlike> amiti: i had the same question, if it is never used I don't understand how introducing it now can help us in the future.
13:21 <@jnewbery> What do we do to peers that send us txs/blocks that are invalid because of CONSENSUS? What do we do if they're invalid for RECENT_CONSENSUS_CHANGE?
13:22 <@jnewbery> amiti: lightlike: right, it's not currently used, but I think the reasoning behind having it as a validation reason is interesting
13:22 < fjahr> I guess a new change would be flagged with this and then this would be used for a conditional to manage behaviour differently. So we don't ban peers who have not upgraded to segwit yet.
13:22 <@jnewbery> There's a clue here: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/a6abc94e9307ea05972ef69732bb148acbfa870a/src/validation.cpp#L1544-L1548
13:23 <@jnewbery> fjahr: yes, that's right (if you replace the word 'segwit' with 'current consensus rules')
13:24 <@jnewbery> Does that make sense to everyone?
13:24 <@jnewbery> does anyone have the answer to this:
13:24 <@jnewbery> > What do we do to peers that send us txs/blocks that are invalid because of CONSENSUS? What do we do if they're invalid for RECENT_CONSENSUS_CHANGE?
13:25 < amiti> https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/net_processing.cpp#L1004
13:25 < fjahr> ah, got it, so segwit is just the point after which this was introduced but there was nothing about segwit that made this necessary in particular.
13:25 <@jnewbery> amiti: you've found the right line. What's it doing?
13:25 < amiti> RECENT_CONSENSUS_CHANGE we just break, but CONSENSUS we invoke misbehaving
13:25 < fjahr> 1. ban 2. nothing
13:26 <@jnewbery> and what does that mean we do the peer?
13:26 <@jnewbery> fjahr: more or less. I think we just disconnect not ban for (1)
13:26 < amiti> do we necessarily ban? or do we just increase the score?
13:27 < amiti> oh, the threshold is 100
13:27 < amiti> and we increase score by 100
13:27 <@jnewbery> no, you're right it's a ban
13:27 <@jnewbery> amiti: right. It's instaban
13:27 < amiti> haha. instaban.
13:28 <@jnewbery> the DOS scores are weird and were somewhar arbitrary until 15141
13:28 < lightlike> i understand it only in parts: Couldn't it be introduced just as well together with the next consensus change instead of now? Has it been implemented now so that future consensus changes don't forget about the idea?
13:29 <@jnewbery> lightlike: Yes, the code isn't exercised now so it could just be added with the next consensus change
13:29 <@jnewbery> I think the best reason for having the code in place now is so future consensus changes don't forget the idea
13:30 <@jnewbery> I think in segwit this was almost forgotten (but that was before i was active in Bitcoin Core so I'm certain about that)
13:30 < michaelfolkson> That would not have been ideal for network stability
13:30 <@jnewbery> the risk is that some portion of the network upgrades, the softfork is activated, and then someone sends a transaction that is invalid under the new rules to nodes that haven't upgraded yet
13:31 <@jnewbery> those old nodes relay the transaction, but if they relay it to an upgraded node then that upgraded node will reject it
13:31 <@jnewbery> we don't want the upgraded nodes to disconnect/ban the unupgraded nodes. That would cause a network split
13:32 <@jnewbery> so we want to treat txs/blocks that fail validation for RECENT_CONSENSUS_CHANGE differently than those that fail for long-standing CONSENSUS rules
13:32 <@jnewbery> (nothing about that changed in this PR, but I thought it was a fun sidetrack)
13:32 < amiti> ok so thats the reason for having the distinction between recent & existing, but the reason that code is _already_ introduced is so its not forgotten about during implementation?
13:32 <@jnewbery> amiti: yes
13:33 < amiti> gotcha. thanks
13:33 < michaelfolkson> I'm wondering if there are better approaches than putting these "placeholders" in
13:33 <@jnewbery> My final question was for all of you to either prepare a question or share an observation you made while reviewing the PR. Anyone have anything?
13:34 < fjahr> What did you think of my idea to move the punishment logic out?
13:34 <@jnewbery> oh, here's some discussion of RECENT_CONSENSUS_CHANGE: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15141#discussion_r247736063
13:35 < fjahr> I saw from other PRs that it is not necessarily a goal to reduce net_processing size but I am still interested
13:35 <@jnewbery> fjahr: I'm not sure it achieves much. peer punishment logic is so tied to net processing logic that separating them into separate translation units doesn't seem like an improvement
13:36 < amiti> jnewbery: I have a question about your git workflow- I noticed you pushed fixup commits in response to reviewer comments, and then squashed & force pushed afterwards. I was wondering if there was a specific reason you did that (vs squash and force push initially)... potentially to make it easier for reviewers to see the recent changes?
13:36 < fjahr> jnewbery: ok, thanks
13:36 <@jnewbery> peer punishment logic wouldn't be required by any other component, which is one reason you'd want to separate them
13:38 <@jnewbery> amiti: yeah, that's it. Just so those reviewers could very quickly see what changes I'd made in response to their comments. Lightlike suggested a much better way to do what he'd asked for, so I was able to throw away my commit and use his suggested method
13:38 <@jnewbery> as soon as those reviewers were happy I just squashed the changes into the relevant commits and force pushed. Verifying that a force-push doesn't change the final code is very quick
13:40 <@jnewbery> if I'd squashed and force-pushed initially and then lightlike had made his suggestion, I'd have wasted a bunch of time changing the initial commit and then changing it back and potentially having to resolve merge conflicts
13:40 <@jnewbery> any other comments/questions?
13:40 < amiti> ah I see. ok thanks
13:40 < michaelfolkson> If nobody else has anything I wouldn't mind chatting more about the punishment logic
13:41 <@jnewbery> michaelfolkson: just ask. No need to ask to ask :)
13:41 < michaelfolkson> So I'm assuming there is no way to trick a honest peer into forwarding a consensus invalid transaction
13:42 < michaelfolkson> I'm wondering if this scoring system is optimal and whether it can be gamed
13:42 <@jnewbery> michaelfolkson: not if the tx fails validation on your node
13:42 < michaelfolkson> Instaban seems pretty confident the peer is dishonest
13:43 <@jnewbery> of course if your node is old or isn't validating the same consensus rules as everyone else and an adversary knows that, then they can send you a tx that isn't valid according to the rest of the network and is valid for you. You'd try to relay that one
13:44 < michaelfolkson> What about the weaker punishments? Discussed in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15141
13:44 <@jnewbery> what do you mean by weaker punishments?
13:45 < lightlike> i think if you send two version messages, you just a get score of 10
13:45 < lightlike> for examlpe
13:45 < michaelfolkson> Oh a lot of them have moved to max punishment (100)
13:46 <@jnewbery> lightlike: it's actually 1
13:46 <@jnewbery> https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/a6abc94e9307ea05972ef69732bb148acbfa870a/src/net_processing.cpp#L1912
13:46 < sdaftuar> an important idea relating to tricking a peer into forwarding a consensus invalid transaction happens with softfork deployment
13:46 < michaelfolkson> Some of them were previously 10/50 points
13:46 < michaelfolkson> But now full ban
13:47 <@jnewbery> which is incredibly arbitrary. We'll tolerate a peer sending us 99 duplicate VERSION messages, but ban them on the 100th
13:47 < sdaftuar> this is why we strive to ensure that features that transactions which will obey new consensus rules are policy-invalid (though obviously not consensus invalid) to old peers
13:47 < sdaftuar> s/that features//
13:48 < michaelfolkson> Interesting
13:48 <@jnewbery> right. We want consensus changes to be policy-invalid for some length of time before they become consensus-invalid
13:49 < michaelfolkson> And we can overwrite the ban if it is a peer that we trust?
13:49 <@jnewbery> note that we don't ban peers for sending us policy-invalid txs: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/a6abc94e9307ea05972ef69732bb148acbfa870a/src/net_processing.cpp#L1073-L1079
13:49 <@jnewbery> michaelfolkson: take a look at whitelisting. We'll never bad/disconnect a whitelisted peer
13:49 < sdaftuar> jnewbery: this gets to the heart of the CONSENSUS_CHANGE vs RECENT_CONSENSUS_CHANGE debate
13:49 < michaelfolkson> <jnewbery>: Yup thanks
13:50 <@jnewbery> Last 10 minutes. Any more questions/observations?
13:51 < michaelfolkson> Just to clarify on <fjahr>'s question. Really long files are ok as long as they don't contain parts that multiple components use?
13:52 < michaelfolkson> Length isn't a variable to consider?
13:53 <@jnewbery> michaelfolkson: it'd be nicer to have shorter source files, where code can be logically split up
13:54 < michaelfolkson> But low on the priority list right?
13:54 <@jnewbery> but in this case, the only places that call MaybeDisconnectPeerForX() are in net_processing, so it doesn't make sense to split it out
13:55 < michaelfolkson> Yeah it would only be for readability I suppose
13:55 < michaelfolkson> Ok thanks
13:55 <@jnewbery> any more questions?
13:57 <@jnewbery> ok, let's wrap it up there. Thanks everyone! And thanks sdaftuar for dropping in
13:57 < lightlike> thanks all!
13:57 <@jnewbery> I'll post next week's PR before this weekend
13:57 < michaelfolkson> Indeed, thanks everyone
13:57 < fjahr> thanks john! and all :)
13:57 < amiti> thanks !
13:58 < diogosergio> Thanks, it was good to follow this up!
