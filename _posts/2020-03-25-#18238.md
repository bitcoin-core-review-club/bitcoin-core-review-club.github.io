## Notes

- Transaction relay is a three step process: `INV` -> `GETDATA` -> `TX`:
  1. the relaying node sends an `INV` message to the receiving node to announce
     a new transaction.
  2. the receiving node sends a `GETDATA` message to the relaying node to
     request the full transaction.
  3. the relaying node delivers a `TX` message to the receiving node. If the
     relaying node is no longer able to deliver the transaciton, it responds
     with `NOTFOUND` instead of the `TX`.

  You can learn more about these messages [here](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Protocol_documentation#inv).

- A node will not have more than one `GETDATA` in flight for a particular
  transaction. The [TxDownloadState struct](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/5504703a9f8388dff66d33bd077bcc4c82dff6c8/src/net_processing.cpp#L340)
  is used to manage the state of transactions for each peer. This struct has a
  very descriptive code comment that gives an overview of how transaction download
  is managed.

- If a `GETDATA` request is in flight, a node will wait up to 2 minutes before timing
  out and attempting to request the transaction from another peer.

- Currently, if a node receives a `NOTFOUND` message, it does not use that
  information to try to speed up requesting it from another peer. Instead, it
  continues to wait until the 2 minute period is over before sending out another
  `GETDATA`.

  This PR introduces logic to speed up a request to another peer when possible.

- [PR 15505](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15505) was a previous attempt
  at implementing a solution and was covered in [PR Review Club
  15505](https://bitcoincore.reviews/15505). Reading the notes / logs /
  PR can help shine light on some of the nuances that make this feature
  tricky to implement.

- Having this retry speedup is [mentioned](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17303#issuecomment-547589047) as a pre-req for [PR 17303](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17303).
  That PR is trying to remove `mapRelay`, a data structure that keeps track of
  recently announced transactions. Doing so would increase the likelihood of
  receiving a `NOTFOUND` message. For example, nodes with small mempools could announce a
  transaction, but then evict it before receiving the `GETDATA`. Without logic
  for the receiving node to quickly retry, the node with a small mempool could be wasting
  bandwidth and accidentally DoS-ing its peer.

## Questions

1. Did you review the PRs? [Concept ACK, approach ACK, tested ACK, or
NACK?](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#peer-review)
(Don't forget to put your PR review on GitHub.)

2. What are some scenarios that lead to `NOTFOUND` messages?

3. How does this PR implement the logic to speed up retries?

4. Upon receiving a `NOTFOUND`, why doesn't the node immediately request the
   transaction from another peer? What does it do instead?

5. In human words, what information does `TxDownloadState` keep track of? What
   does this PR change?

6. PR 15505 review comments discussed various approaches for identifying which
   peer to request for the transaction after receiving a `NOTFOUND`. How does
   PR 18238 answer that question?

7. Why do we treat inbound and outbound peers differently? How does this PR
   manage preferential treatment?

8. Zooming back out to a birds-eye view, what are potential issues that could
   be introduced with this approach? What are other possiblities for how
   transaction relay could handle unresponsive peers?
