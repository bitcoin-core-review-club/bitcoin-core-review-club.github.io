There was a [previous review club meeting on PR 19055](./19055) when the PR
included calculating the Muhash of the UTXO set. That review club session
focused on the high-level concepts of using Muhash as a rolling hash for the
UTXO set.

The scope of the PR has since been reduced to only include the implementation
of the Muhash algorithm in C++. In this review club meeting, we'll dig into the
cryptographic code in detail.

## Notes

- This PR is an implementation of the Muhash algorithm, which was first described
  in the paper [A New Paradigm for Collision-free Hashing: Incrementality at
  Reduced Cost](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~mihir/papers/inchash.pdf) by Bellare
  and Micciancio. Pieter Wuille wrote a mailing list post in 2017 on [Rolling
  UTXO set
  hashes](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2017-May/014337.html),
  which compared Muhash with Elliptic Curve Multiset Hash (another possible way
  of implementing rolling hashes). You should read Wuille's mailing list post
  before starting to review the code. You can also look at the Bellare-Micciancio
  paper, but it's more detail than you'll need in order to review the
  implementation.

- A Python implementation of the Muhash algorithm was merged in [PR
  19105](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19105) last month. We
  discussed that in [a previous PR review club meeting](./19105). As you review
  the new code, you may find it helpful to compare it with the Python
  implementation. Python's built-in support for bignums and modular inverses are
  much easier to follow than the optimized C++ code.

- The new code is in the
  [src/crypto](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/tree/pr19055-2/src/crypto)
  directory, which also includes implementations of other frequently used
  cryptographic functions. Take a look at the SHA256, SHA3 and SipHash
  implementations, and you'll notice some similarities in the way the interfaces
  are designed.

## Questions

### Specification

1. How much state is stored inside the MuHash3072 rolling hash object? How much
   data is returned to a user requesting the set hash?

2. Why was 3072 bits chosen as the size of the group?

3. Can the Muhash of a single object (eg a transaction) be calculated and cached?
   Would we do this in practice?

4. What is the most expensive operation to carry out in the rolling hash? What can
   we do to reduce the number of times we need to carry out this operation?

5. How can we test for membership in the Muhash set?

### Implementation

1. What public methods does the `MuHash3072` object expose to clients? What is the
   `Span<>` class template that's used in some of those public methods?

2. What does the `#ifdef HAVE___INT128` [code in
   muhash.h](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/blob/e19e50013478c6b7066aa2c9f7e0d0ee7219e837/src/crypto/muhash.h#L17)
   do?

3. How is a `MuHash3072` object constructed and initialized? What happens if the
   ChaCha20 output is larger than the group order?

4. What happens if the result of a multiplication or division is larger than
   the order of the group?

5. The `Finalize()` method has a comment "Does not change this object's value."
   Why is the function not marked `const`?

6. In some of the multiplication helper functions, we see lines like:

   `c1 = t >> LIMB_SIZE;`

   e.g. [here](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/blob/e19e50013478c6b7066aa2c9f7e0d0ee7219e837/src/crypto/muhash.cpp#L51).

   What are those lines doing?

7. In some of the helper functions, we see some ternary operators like:

   `th += (c0 < tl) ? 1 : 0;`

   e.g. [here](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/blob/e19e50013478c6b7066aa2c9f7e0d0ee7219e837/src/crypto/muhash.cpp#L88).

   What is `th` here? Why does it need to be incremented by 1 if `c0` < `tl`?

8. Both the `Multiply()` and `Square()` functions have the following code at
   the end of the function:

   ```
       /* Perform a potential third reduction. */
       if (c0) FullReduce(in_out);
   ```

   Why is that necessary? What is it doing?

9. Did you review the `Inverse()` function? Did [AJ's
   comment](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19055#discussion_r492832419)
   help? 

10. How is this new code tested? Can you think of other ways that it could be
    tested?
