There was a [previous review club meeting on PR 19055](./19055) when the PR
included calculating the Muhash of the UTXO set. That review club session
focused on the high-level concepts of using Muhash as a rolling hash for the
UTXO set.

The scope of the PR has since been reduced to only include the implementation
of the Muhash algorithm in C++. In this review club meeting, we'll dig into the
cryptographic code in detail.
