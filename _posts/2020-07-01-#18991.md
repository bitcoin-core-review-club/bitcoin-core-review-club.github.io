## Notes

- The motivation for [PR 18991](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18991)
  is to make the `ADDR`/`GETADDR` address gossip protocol more private for the
  node providing addresses.

- Nodes transmit three main objects over the p2p network:
  transactions, blocks and network addresses (eg 172.1.2.3). Today's PR is
  concerned with network address gossiping.

- There are 2 relevant p2p messages:
  [`GETADDR`](https://btcinformation.org/en/developer-reference#getaddr) (the
  sender requests the receiver for network addresses
  along with some per-address metadata) and
  [`ADDR`](https://btcinformation.org/en/developer-reference#addr) (the receiver
  responds with the requested data they want to share
  with the sender).

- This `GETADDR`/`ADDR` protocol is currently used every time a node makes a new
  connection, after receiving the version message.

- There are other ways of learning about potential peers, which are not 
  relevant to this PR, but it's worth being aware of them:

  - Network addresses of the nodes are propagated in the
    network in an unsolicited way: from time to time, every node makes a
    self-announcement which is propagated across the network.

  - Nodes can query predefined DNS seeds for a list of potential peers.

- Every time a node hears about another node in the network, it adds/updates
  a record in its _AddrMan_ (Address Manager). This is where all the data
  about nodes in the network is stored, and this is where a `GETADDR` receiver
  looks to construct an `ADDR` response to the requester.

- It turns out that it's possible for a spy node to easily scrape the full
  contents of any reachable node's AddrMan. The spy just has to connect to a
  victim node multiple times and execute `GETADDR`. This scraped data can then be
  used to infer private information about the victim.

- For example, a spy can monitor the victim's AddrMan content in real time and
  figure out which peers a node is connected to. A spy can also compare the
  AddrMan content of from two different connections (eg one identified by Tor
  address and one identified by IPv4) and figure out it's actually the same
  physical node.

- This PR is a first step to fix these privacy issues. If we limit (cache)
  the leaked portion of AddrMan, these inference activities will become much
  harder. Caching in this context means that `ADDR` response (which is only a small
  subset of a node's AddrMan content) remains same for every GETADDR call during
  (roughly) a day.

## Questions

1. Did you review the PR? [Concept ACK, approach ACK, tested ACK, or
   NACK?](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#peer-review)
   You're always encouraged to put your PR review on GitHub, even after it has
   been merged

2. What is the importance of `ADDR` relay and specifically `GETADDR`/`ADDR`
   protocol? What are the goals of this protocol? Which properties of `ADDR`
   relay are important?

3. Do you understand the examples of the attacks described above? Can you think
   of any other ways to exploit scraping AddrMan? If you find something really
   dangerous, consider discussing this with some other developer privately first.

4. Do you think the attacks are severe? What are the potential consequences of
   making the topology (local or global) public?

5. Do you think the suggested PR sufficiently addresses the problem?

6. What are the side effects of the suggested solution?
