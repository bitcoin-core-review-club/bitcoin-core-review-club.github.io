## Notes

### Context

- This PR builds on [PR #17951](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17951)
  "Use rolling bloom filter of recent block txs for AlreadyHave() check" by the
    same author, which was just merged.

### What is a `wtxid`?

- [BIP
  141](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0141.mediawiki#specification)
  (Segregated Witness) introduced the definition of `wtxid`:
    - "A new wtxid is defined: the double SHA256 of the new serialization with
      witness data."
    - "If all txins (transaction inputs) are not witness program, a transaction's
      wtxid is equal to its txid."
- [PR #11203](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11203) added `wtxid` to
  the mempool entry output of `entryToJSON()` in src/rpc/blockchain.cpp,
  thereby exposing wtxids to callers in the output of RPCs `getmempoolentry`,
  `getmempooldescendants`, `getmempoolancestors`, and `getrawmempool`.

### Using wtxid for transaction relay

- Using the txid (which does not include the witness) is problematic because
  the witness can be malleated without changing the txid. See
  [#8279](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/8279) for a full discussion
  of the issue.

- The [PR notes](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18044#issue-369668879)
  contain a very full and clear description of the motivation and changes.
