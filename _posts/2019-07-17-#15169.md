title: "#15169 Parallelize CheckInputs() in AcceptToMemoryPool()"
---

[https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15169](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15169)

## Notes

* The [CheckInputs()](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/8f9725c83f1da5364354d2820696c84d542d3d37/src/validation.cpp#L1234) function is called when checking the inputs to a transaction. Each input has a script which is verified. That verification can be run:
    - sequentially and synchronously, in which case `CheckInputs()` will return `true` if all scripts pass verification or pass back the error for the first script that failed verification; or
    - in parallel, in which case `CheckInputs()` will emplace the script check onto a queue for future verification.
* Previously, `CheckInputs()` would always check inputs sequentially when accepting a transaction to the mempool. Transaction inputs [can](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/8f604361ebaa5263e614c21570a3256e4dbc3bcc/src/init.cpp#L401) be checked in parallel during block validation. Note the [`vChecks` argument when calling `CheckInputs()` from `ConnectBlock()`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/8f9725c83f1da5364354d2820696c84d542d3d37/src/validation.cpp#L1887).
* This PR enables the input checks to be performed in parallel when a transaction is entering the mempool. 
* It does so by replacing calls to `CheckInputs()` with [`RunCheckInputsMaybeParallel()`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/cb0c42cfda7669f3df57c167cf0d691f926039d2#diff-24efdb00bfbe56b140fb006b562cc70bR1679), which will push the input checks to an existing `CCheckQueue` worker queue.
  * [`CheckInputs`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/8f9725c83f1da5364354d2820696c84d542d3d37/src/validation.cpp#L1234)
  * [`CCheckQueue`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/8f9725c83f1da5364354d2820696c84d542d3d37/src/validation.cpp#L1528) (Currently used for block validation)
  * [Script check worker loop](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/8f9725c83f1da5364354d2820696c84d542d3d37/src/checkqueue.h#L66) (Currently used for block validation)
* There is a significant performance gain resulting from this optimization.
* This PR also changes behavior when transactions are denied mempool acceptance. `RunCheckInputsMaybeParallel` (and by extension [`CheckInputs()`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/5f4e514412fc39e174f298a7737eb9f08a82a86b#diff-24efdb00bfbe56b140fb006b562cc70bL1436)) no longer set TX_NOT_STANDARD during input check failure, but only a consensus failure state.
* Note: This has an effect on peer connections. 
    * Current behaviour: A peer is disconnected when a consensus-invalid transaction is received, but remains connected if the transaction is only policy-invalid (non-standard).
    * Preposed behaviour: A peer is no longer disconnected, even if a consensus-invalid transaction is received.

## Questions

* When does `RunCheckInputsMaybeParallel()` still potentially call `CheckInputs()`?
* How are the input check jobs dispatched to the thread pool? How are the check results returned after execution?
* Does `RunCheckInputsMaybeParallel()` set the same "invalid reason" on input check failure as `CheckInputs()`?
* If not, why is this not possible?
* How does this change affect RPC methods such as [`testmempoolaccept`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/cb0c42cfda7669f3df57c167cf0d691f926039d2#diff-01aa7d1d32f1b9e5a836c9c411978918L928)?
* What effect does the modified input check failure behaviour have on peer connections?
* What was the reason to modify the behavior in AcceptToMempoolWorker() when input checks fail? Should this be separate PR?
