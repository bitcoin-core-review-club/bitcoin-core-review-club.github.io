title: "#15505 [p2p] Request NOTFOUND transactions immediately from other outbound peers, when possible (p2p)"
---

[https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15505](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15505)

## Notes
- The basic message flow for transaction relay is `INV -> GETDATA -> TX`. A node that cannot deliver a requested transaction answers the `GETDATA` request with `NOTFOUND` instead of `TX`.
- `NOTFOUND` messages were introduced in [Bitcoin Core PR 2192](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2192) and are documented in the [Bitcoin developer reference](https://btcinformation.org/en/developer-reference#notfound).
- Historically, Bitcoin Core would ignore `NOTFOUND` messages it received. This changed slightly with [PR 15834](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15834), ([Review Club Session](https://bitcoin-core-review-club.github.io/15834.html)), which introduced internal bookkeeping measures in response to a NOTFOUND (clearing the internal map of in-flight transactions).
- This PR suggests to actually utilize the info of a `NOTFOUND` by immediately requesting the transaction from outbound peers having `INV`'ed it to us before.
- This PR touches the central P2P loop `CConnman::ThreadMessageHandler()`  by adding a sequence counter to `SendMessages()`. This counter is used to deterministically select one outbound peer in each loop cycle from which  we request transactions for which we have received a `NOTFOUND` from another peer.

## Questions:
- What is the most typical situation when running a node in which `NOTFOUND` messages are encountered?
- Why was the solution with the sequence counter chosen, instead of simpler alternatives like a random draw?
- Why are only outbound peers considered for requesting transactions after receiving `NOTFOUND`?
- What kind of options exist in the functional testing framework for P2P functionality? Why is it so hard to test PRs like this one with the existing framework?
