## Notes

- A node allows a limited number of connections, the default is 125. When this
limit is reached, the node reacts to the connection of a new inbound peer by
terminating the connection with an existing inbound peer ("eviction").

- Certain peers are protected from eviction by a heuristic algorithm, based on
various metrics such as netgroup, connection time, ping time, them having sent
us transactions or blocks. This is implemented in
[`CConnman::AttemptToEvictConnection()`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/dec067f5a019fbeea0403efcfc501238a114d095/src/net.cpp#L857)
and was added in [PR #6374](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6374) and
extended in [PR #8084](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8084).

- The eviction logic is currently covered by neither functional nor unit tests
([Test Coverage](https://marcofalke.github.io/btc_cov/total.coverage/src/net.cpp.gcov.html#808)), which was noticed in Issue [#16660 ](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/16660).

- This PR suggests a functional test for the eviction mechanism, covering
protection of fast responding peers and peers that have sent us transactions
and blocks. This is achieved by adding several mininode peers with different
properties and testing that after reaching the maximum number of connections,
a peer is being evicted, which is not among the peers assumed to be protected.


## Questions

1. Did you review the PR? [Concept ACK, approach ACK, tested ACK, or
   NACK?](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#peer-review)
   (Don't forget to put your PR review on GitHub.)

2. Why is there an eviction mechanism for inbound peers, instead of simply not
   accepting new connections when full?

3. Why are some peers protected from eviction?

4. Can you summarize the algorithm by which the candidate for eviction is
   determined in `AttemptToEvictConnection()`?

5. Why does the test choose `maxconnections=32`?

6. What are the challenges in testing the eviction logic? Can you think of ways
   to extend the coverage of the functional test?

7. What do you think of the algorithm for eviction/protection?
   Do you have ideas for improvement?
