title: "BIP-325: Signet"
pr: 18267

components: ["consensus", "validation"]
host: pinheadmz
status: upcoming
commit: 6e5e3b3355

The [Bitcoin wiki](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Signet) defines signet as
"a proposed new test network for the Bitcoin block chain which adds an
additional signature requirement to block validation."

This pull request implements the portion of
[BIP325](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0325.mediawiki)
responsible for connecting to a signet network and validating blocks (it does
not implement the code required by miners to sign signet blocks). We are
touching consensus-critical code today! Let's make sure we do it right :-)

Because this PR is rather large, we are going to focus on the first four
commits:

- [validation: move GetWitnessCommitmentIndex to consensus/validation](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/commit/9620f95e)

- [add signet basic support (signet.cpp)](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/commit/7f9f3d30)

- [add signet chain and accompanying parameters](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/commit/699668ca)

- [consensus: add signet validation](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/commit/22d28831)

Once the PR branch is built, you can connect to signet by creating a new data
directory and launching the development build of Bitcoin Core:

```
# make a new data directory
$ mkdir /absolute/path/to/datadir/for/signet

# enter the bitcoin repo where this PR is built locally
$ cd bitcoin

# launch!
$ src/bitcoind -signet -datadir=/absolute/path/to/datadir/for/signet

# generate a signet address
$ src/bitcoin-cli -signet -datadir=/absolute/path/to/datadir/for/signet getnewaddress
```

## Notes

- The PR author, [kallewoof](https://github.com/kallewoof), maintains a signet
  [faucet](https://signet.bc-2.jp/). If you can run the branch and generate a
  signet address, you can request a payout!

- At the start of this meeting, I'll ask everyone for their signet address and
  reward participants who answer questions correctly or ask their own good
  questions!

## Questions

1. Why do we need test networks and what problems (if any) do we have with the
   current testnet?

2. What are some of the
   [parameters](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/blob/pr18267/src/chainparams.cpp)
   that distinguish mainnet, testnet and signet?  Which of these do the
   different networks have in common? What makes signet special?

3. How many signets are there? Could we start our own just for review club, and
   if so, how?

4. What parts of this PR affect consensus-critical code for nodes running on
   mainnet?

5. What new
   [configuration options](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/blob/pr18267/src/chainparamsbase.cpp)
   have been added?

6. What are `CMutableTransaction tx_to_spend` and `CMutableTransaction
   tx_spending`? (Defined in
   [`src/signet.cpp`](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/blob/pr18267/src/signet.cpp#L68-L80))
   Who broadcasts these transactions?

7. Why was `GetWitnessCommitmentIndex()` moved? Was anything altered?

8. (bonus) Did you build the GUI? How does it look
   [different](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/blob/pr18267/src/qt/networkstyle.cpp#L22)
   from mainnet?

9. (double bonus) [Why is the signet commitment concatenated to the witness
   commitment and not in its own
   `OP_RETURN`?](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/947/files#r463053062)
