## Questions

- Did you review the PR? Concept ACK, approach ACK, tested ACK, or NACK?

- Why was this PR written and considered high-priority?

- Which roles and classes are being separated in the first commit?

- Why is a unique_ptr used rather than a shared_ptr? What are the trade-offs?
  Is this mentioned in the Bitcoin Core [developer
  notes](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/developer-notes.md)?

- Describe the Adapter pattern in 1-2 sentences. What is another frequent name
  for it? What are two general kinds of adapters? Which of the two kinds is more
  flexible, and what might be the trade-off? Which kind is used in this PR, and
  who are the participants (target, client, adaptee, adapter)?

- Any other comments, feedback, or questions?
