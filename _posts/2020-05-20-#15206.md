_Note: an earlier version of this PR moved hash finalization from the Message
Handler thread to the Socket Handler thread. That actually happened in [PR
16202](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16202), so you can ignore
discussion about moving the hash calculation._

## Notes

- Peer-to-peer message headers include a _checksum_ for message integrity. If
  any of the message gets corrupted, then the calculated checksum from the
  payload won't match the checksum in the header. See [the developer
  notes](https://btcinformation.org/en/developer-reference#message-headers) for
  full details of the message header format.

- The checksum is the first four bytes of the double-SHA256 of the message
  payload.

- SHA256() is a [Merkle–Damgård hash
  function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle%E2%80%93Damg%C3%A5rd_construction).
  In this hash function construction, the pre-image is split into blocks, which
  are fed one-by-one into a compression function.

- Because of the serial way that the hash is constructed, we can do some of the
  hashing work in the Socket Handler thread as we receive the bytes of the
  wire. See the [readData()](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/951870807ea28e05cf074e364e1b55e985ab9f6d/src/net.cpp#L664)
  function, which calls into [`CSHA256::Write()`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/951870807ea28e05cf074e364e1b55e985ab9f6d/src/net.cpp#L664).

- The final round of hashing is done in
  [`GetMessageHash()`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/951870807ea28e05cf074e364e1b55e985ab9f6d/src/net.cpp#L681),
  which calls through to
  [`CSHA256::Finalize()`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/951870807ea28e05cf074e364e1b55e985ab9f6d/src/hash.h#L28).

- Prior to [PR 16202](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16202),
  `GetMessageHash()` was called by `ProcessMessages()`, which is executed by
  the Message Handler thread. After that PR, the hash finalization is done
  in the Socket Hander thread, and the Message Handler thread just checks
  the saved `hash` data member.

- If the calculated checksum does not match the checksum in the message header,
  then the message is dropped.

- This PR proposes removing any checksum logic from net_processing, and moving
  it to net. It also proposes immediately disconnecting peers that send us
  a message with a bad checksum.

## Questions

1. Did you review the PR? [Concept ACK, approach ACK, tested ACK, or
   NACK?](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#peer-review)
   (Don't forget to put your PR review on GitHub.)

2. What are the benefits of handling bad checksums in the net layer instead of
   in net processing?

3. Are there any other checks that should be moved from net processing into net?

4. What do you think about the behaviour change in this PR? Is it better to simply
   drop the message or should we disconnect from the peer?
