This week, we'll review two (small) PRs:

- [O(1) OP_IF/NOTIF/ELSE/ENDIF script implementation](https://github.com/bitcoin/pull/16902)
- [Abstract out script execution out of VerifyWitnessProgram()](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18002)

## Notes

Both of these PRs were pulled out of the [Taproot/Schnorr demonstration
branch in PR 17977](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17977). They both
make small, non-behaviour-changing modifications to script execution.

Script execution is an area of the code that is very rarely modified. As the
author notes in #18002 "As it touches consensus code, I don't think this would
ordinarily meet the bar for review cost vs benefit. However, it simplifies the
changes for Taproot significantly, and [..] it's going to be necessitated by
inclusion of that code ... "

Generally, for consensus code, the _if it ain't broke, don't fix it_ rule
prevails. We might also add _if it is broke [in a non-critical way], probably
don't fix it either because you might break consensus_.

### O(1) OP_IF/NOTIF/ELSE/ENDIF script implementation

- Bitcoin Script is a stack language. A script consists of data elements that
  can be pushed onto the stack, and opcodes which manipulate the stack
  elements. See [the Bitcoin wiki Script
  page](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Script) for a good description of the
  language.

- Script allows branching control flow by using the
  **OP_IF**/**OP_NOTIF**/**OP_ELSE**/**OP_ENDIF** opcodes. These branches can
  be nested multiple levels.

- Script evaluation happens in `EvalScript()` in `src/script/interpreter.cpp`. The
  evaluation iterates through the script elements (`while (pc < pend)`) and switches
  on what that element is (`switch (opcode)`).

- if/else branching is tracked by a boolean vector `vfExec`:

  - When execution encounters an **OP_IF** or **OP_NOTIF** opcode (and
    therefore descends a level of if/else nesting), a boolean is pushed onto
    this vector: `true` if we're entering a branch that should be executed and
   `false` for a branch that shouldn't be executed.

  - When execution encounters an **OP_ELSE** opcode, the topmost boolean
    in the vector is flipped.

  - When execution encounters an **OP_ENDIF** opcode, the topmost boolean in
    the vector is popped off.

- At the beginning of the `while (pc < pend)` loop, we determine whether we're in
  a branch that should be executed by examining the `vfExec` vector and setting
  a `fExec` boolean: true if all of the elements in the vector are true, and false
  otherwise. If `fExec` is false, then we're in a branch that shouldn't be
  executed and we continue to the next iteration of the while loop.

- This check involves iterating through a vector which is the length of the nested
  if branches. The check is done for every element of the script. In the worst case
  the time to do all checks grows quadratically. See [Sergio Demian Lerner's
  blog
  post](https://bitslog.com/2017/04/17/new-quadratic-delays-in-bitcoin-scripts/)
  for a good description of the problem.

- This quadratic behaviour is not currently a problem, since the maximum number of
  opcodes that can be included in a script is 201. In the pessimal case, the quadratic
  behaviour can be used to construct a block that takes 0.25s to validate. There
  are other expensive-to-validate scripts that can be used to construct a block
  that takes longer than that to validate.

- [Tapscript does not have a 201 opcode
  limit](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0342.mediawiki#resource-limits).
  If this behaviour is not fixed before taproot activation, it could therefore
  be exploited to construct blocks that are very slow to validate.

- This PR changes the boolean vector to be a pair of integers, which makes the
  `fExec` check O(1) instead of O(n), and so removes the quadratic behaviour.

### Abstract out script execution out of VerifyWitnessProgram()

- This is a small refactor PR that abstracts out a part of the
  `VerifyWitnessProgram()` function into its own function called
  `ExecuteWitnessProgram()`.

## Questions

1. Did you review the PRs? [Concept ACK, approach ACK, tested ACK, or
NACK?](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#peer-review)
(Don't forget to put your PR review on GitHub.)

2. The fuctions in `ConditionStack()` contain asserts. What happens if these
   asserts are hit?

3. How are we able to express a vector of booleans as a pair of integers? What
   observation about the use of the vector makes this possible?

4. In the notes, I've written "If `fExec` is false, then we're in a branch that
   shouldn't be executed and we continue to the next iteration of the while
   loop." That's not quite the full story. When do we not continue to the next
   iteration while `fExec` is false?

5. Did you run the `verify_script()` benchmark? Does this PR make a difference
   to performance?
