## Notes

* [PR 19031](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19031) is a proposed implementation of the [BIP 155](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/9286b5254317d9e73fb25c5f0acd2b2d9937843e/bip-0155.mediawiki) `addrv2` messages, a new p2p message format proposed in early 2019 by Wladimir J. van der Laan to gossip longer node addresses. This is required to support next-generation Onion addresses, I2P, and potentially other networks that have longer endpoint addresses than fit in the 128 bits of the current `addr` message.

* To ease review, PR 19031 was converted to a roadmap and separated into a series of smaller PRs. The first one in the series, [PR 19351](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19351) "test: add an edge case test for CSubNet", has been merged. [PR 19360](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19360) "net: improve encapsulation of CNetAddr" is the second PR in the series and currently under review.

* The `addr` message  relays connection information, including IP addresses, for peers on the Bitcoin network.  `addr` uses IPv6 addresses; IPv4 addresses are provided as IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses.  More information [here](https://btcinformation.org/en/developer-reference#addr).

* The BIP 155 `addrv2` messages would allow not only longer addresses, but also variable-length ones for future extensibility.

* Bitcoin has Tor integration.  Relevant to PR 19031 is the fact that Tor v2 addresses are 16 characters long, nicely fitting in the 16 bytes needed for an IPv6 address.  Tor v3 ([meta issue here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/18884)), aka Next Gen Onion Services, has been out since 2017.  It requires 56-character addresses and therefore needs `addrv2`.  For more information on Tor v3, see [this page](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/NextGenOnions) on the Tor Bug Tracker and Wiki site.

* PR 19031 is a fairly large PR.  For the purposes of this PR Review Club, here is a suggested approach for study and review:
  * Review [PR 19360](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19360) (this is also the first commit of PR 19031).
  * Read [BIP 155](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/9286b5254317d9e73fb25c5f0acd2b2d9937843e/bip-0155.mediawiki).  There is ongoing discussion on [BIP 155](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/9286b5254317d9e73fb25c5f0acd2b2d9937843e/bip-0155.mediawiki) happening at [BIPs PR 907](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/907).  Because of this, please review [BIP 155](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/9286b5254317d9e73fb25c5f0acd2b2d9937843e/bip-0155.mediawiki) at any of the links in these notes as they reflect the current status of the BIP.
  * See [this comment](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/907#issuecomment-611924492) in BIPs PR 907 about how to signal support for `addrv2`.  The current decision can be seen [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/9286b5254317d9e73fb25c5f0acd2b2d9937843e/bip-0155.mediawiki#Signaling_support_and_compatibility).
  * Read through all of the conceptual comments in 19031.
  * Skim commits 2-4 of PR 19031.  The goal should be to get context for what future PRs will cover and to see how the implementation of [BIP 155](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/9286b5254317d9e73fb25c5f0acd2b2d9937843e/bip-0155.mediawiki) matches the specification.

## Questions

1. Did you review the PR? [Concept ACK, approach ACK, tested ACK, or
   NACK](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#peer-review)?
   You're always encouraged to put your PR review on GitHub, even after it has
   been merged.

2. What are the differences between `addr` and the new `addrv2`?

3. Do you agree with how [PR 19031](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19031) is being split up into smaller PRs?  Would you rather the "reviewable" PRs be larger and include more commits?  What are the advantages and disadvantages of this choice?

4. Do you agree with how `addrv2` support is being signaled?  What are some alternatives?

5. Why is Tor v3 being considered?

6. What are some other protocols that could be added here?  Are they all compatible with `addrv2`, or will we need an `addrv3` in the future?
