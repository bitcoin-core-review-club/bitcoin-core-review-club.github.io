## Notes

* [PR 19031](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19031) is the
  implementation of [BIP
  155](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0155.mediawiki), the
  `addrv2` message.

* The smaller PR that's currently being worked on, and should be reviewed
  first, is [PR 19360](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19360).

* Ultimately this will allow us to work with [Tor
  v3](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/18884), along with many other
  different types of networks.
