title: "Treat handshake misbehavior like unknown message"

## Notes

- The Bitcoin P2P network is open for anyone to join and peers are generally
  assumed to be untrusted. A node can function as long as it has at least one
  well-behaved connection to the network to participate in block and
  transaction relay.

- Bitcoin Core has several options for how to treat peers that violate the
  rules of the P2P protocol:

  - ignore the individual message, but continue processing other messages
    from that peer;
  - increment the peer's "misbehavior" score, and punish the peer once its
    score goes above a certain amount
  - disconnect from the peer
  - disconnect from the peer and prevent any later connections from that
    peer's address (discouragement)

- Today's pull request 20079 was created as a follow up to [PR
  19723](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19723), which changed how
  non-verack messages are treated when the peer hasn't yet sent a verack
  message.

## Questions

1. Did you review the PRs? [Concept ACK, approach ACK, ACK, or
   NACK?](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#peer-review)

2. What message types can be sent/received during a handshake? Which are
   optional? In what order can they be sent?

3. What happens if the peer doesn't complete the handshake?

4. How are incorrect message from peers dealt with during the handshake? How
   does the pull request change that?

5. What are the risks or benefits of disconnecting a peer?

6. What are your thoughts on balancing the risks and benefits of disconnecting
   peers? What should be used as criteria to disconnect a peer?
