## Notes

* [AcceptToMemoryPool](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/c831e105/src/validation.cpp#L1084)
  (ATMP) processes a transaction for acceptance to the mempool.  In addition to
  enforcing consensus rules, it also applies the node’s policy.
  [#19339](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19339) deals with acceptance
  logic that falls into neither category… and thus doesn’t belong in validation!

* For reference,
  [policy](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/tree/c831e105/src/policy)
  represents a node’s extra standards for validation, typically applied in
  situations where it may be appropriate to apply rules in addition to consensus.
  It includes things like fees (e.g.
  [`-minrelaytxfee`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/c831e105/src/init.cpp#L547))
  and extra verification
  [flags](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/c831e105/src/policy/policy.h#L56)
  (e.g. `SCRIPT_VERIFY_DISCOURAGE_UPGRADEABLE*`).

  - This contrasts with consensus rules, which are universally applied.
  - This also contrasts with user- or client-specific rules (one node may have
    multiple clients).

* Pre-19339, ATMP accepts an argument, `const CAmount& nAbsurdFee`, and
  enforces it as a maximum fee amount; this protects users from paying
  “absurdly high” fees resulting from an unintentional error.  ATMP returns a
  `TxValidationResult::TX_NOT_STANDARD` error for absurd fees, which seems to
  suggest that rejecting absurd fees is part of policy.

* However, `nAbsurdFee` is only used for transactions originating from the
  node’s clients (RPC and wallet).  When a node receives a transaction from its
  peers, it uses an empty value for `nAbsurdFee` when calling ATMP (you can see
  the values of `nAbsurdFee` removed in the [Remove absurdfee from
  accepttomempool](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/commit/67bb7148)
  commit).  Furthermore, there is no way for a node operator to set the maximum
  fee, e.g. through a config setting or command line argument.  The wallet, on
  the other hand, allows the user to set a maximum fee using `-maxtxfee`.

* [#19339](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19339) redelegates fee
  checking from the mempool to the clients in order to make mempool logic less
  user-specific.  The main observable behavior change is in the error message,
  which is updated to include RPC.

  * Note that this only changes RPCs
    [`testmempoolaccept`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/3ab2582c/src/rpc/rawtransaction.cpp#L858)
    and
    [`sendrawtransaction`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/3ab2582c/src/rpc/rawtransaction.cpp#L800).
    There are no changes to wallet (reviewers may want to verify that this is not
    an issue).

  * Note that clients often use
    [`BroadcastTransaction()`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/3ab2582c/src/node/transaction.cpp#L16)
    to interface with ATMP; it also takes `max_tx_fee` to pass in as `nAbsurdFee`.
    This PR adds fee checking to `BroadcastTransaction()` by adding a dry run of
    ATMP before the real submission.

* To be careful to preserve the fee protection offered to the user, the PR
  includes a few intermediate stages.  The author recommends reviewing each
  commit individually and confirming that the behavior is identical at each
  stage.

  1. [Catch mempool rejections based on `AbsurdFee` and return
     `max-fee-exceeded` instead of `absurdly-high-fee` for high
     fees](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/commit/18f7e1fb).

  2. [In `BroadcastTransaction`, first dry-run ATMP and check the fee that is
     returned](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/commit/a872d8d3).
     If the fee is below `max_tx_fee`, send the transaction for real.

  3. [Ignore `nAbsurdFee` in
     ATMP](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/commit/24094623).

  4. [Remove `nAbsurdFee` from
     ATMP](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/commit/67bb7148).

## Questions

1. Did you review the PR? [Concept ACK, approach ACK, tested ACK, or
   NACK](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#peer-review)?

2. Does this PR change any behavior or is it a pure refactor?

3. There was some discussion as to whether AbsurdFee is policy or a client
   preference.  What do you think, and how did you determine this?

4. Compare the implementations of the `testmempoolaccept` and
   `sendrawtransaction` RPCs.  What are the differences? (hint: `test_accept`)

5. What information do you need to check a transaction’s fee?  At what point
   would the node have this information on hand?

6. How does the wallet handle the user's maximum fees? (hint:
   `m_default_max_tx_fee`) Do any changes to the wallet need to be made?

7. Let's consider the cost of dry-running ATMP beforehand: what is cached and
   what do we have to do all over again?  Is this a performance concern? Why or
   why not?

8. Bonus: _should_ there be a maximum fee policy, e.g. `-maxrelaytxfee` for
   nodes?  Why or why not would a node/miner want to avoid relaying
   transactions with very high fees?
