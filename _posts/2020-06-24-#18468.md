**Note:** The PR being discussed ([#18468: Span Improvements](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18468))
originally included commit [`Support conversion between Spans of compatible types `](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18591/commits/0fbde488b24f62b4bbbde216647941dcac65c81a)
that was merged as part of [#18591: Add C++17 build to Travis](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18591). We will be discussing
the changes in that commit as well, as they functionally belong together.

## Notes

- Today's PR is the recently-merged [#18468: Span Improvements](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18468).
  It brings our `Span` type closer to the functionality of C++20's proposed [`std::span`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/span), and
  then demonstrates some of its uses by simplifying code that uses it in various places.

- A `Span` can be thought of as a pair of a pointer to some data type together with a length,
  identifying a range of contiguous elements in memory. In many ways it acts like a vector,
  but it doesn't own any data --- which means no copying of the actual data is involved. It is
  an extremely lightweight object, but it does come with a cost: higher-level code is responsible
  for guaranteeing that the pointed-to data is still available.

- `std::span` is a new data type that will likely be part of the upcoming C++20 standard
  (see the cppreference.com page on [std::span](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/span)).
  While Bitcoin Core won't switch to that standard any time soon (we're currently on C++11, and will
  be transitioning to C++17 over the next 2 releases), it is a remarkably useful and simple
  abstraction, which is why we have our own backported version that is C++11 compatible.
  `Span` isn't quite as powerful as `std::span`, but today's PR brings it a lot closer.

- The gist of the changes is introducing implicit construction of `Span` objects from range-like
  objects ([arrays](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/array),
  [`std::array`s](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/array),
  [`std::vector`s](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/vector),
  [`prevector`s](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/f3d776b59380ad31e8b3a2948364c7690eebe05d/src/prevector.h),
  [`std::string`s](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/string/basic_string), ...), and
  automatic conversion between `Span` of compatible member types. Implicit construction and
  conversion is a powerful but dangerous C++ feature that should be used cautiously. Most of
  the complexity in the code changes is in making sure these operations cannot be used in
  dangerous or unexpected ways.

- Several other PRs have been merged and proposed that make use of `Span`. Looking over those
  may give an intuition for why this data type is so useful:
  - [#12886: Introduce Span type and use it instead of FLATDATA](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12886)
  - [#13062: Make script interpreter independent from storage type CScript](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13062)
  - [#13697: Support output descriptors in scantxoutset](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13697)
  - [#18388: Make VerifyWitnessProgram use a Span stack](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18388)
  - [#19320: wallet: Replace CDataStream& with Span\<char\> where possible](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19320)
  - [#19326: Simplify hash.h interface using Spans](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19326)

## Questions

1. Did you review the PR? [Concept ACK, approach ACK, tested ACK, or
   NACK?](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#peer-review)
   (You're always encouraged to put your PR review on GitHub, even after it has been merged)

2. Do you think `Span` is a useful abstraction? Can you think of more places where it could
   be used to simplify existing code?

3. When reviewing the PR, did you compare with the proposed
   [std::span](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/span) interface? What differences
   did you notice?

4. What condition is imposed on converting `Span<T1>` into a `Span<T2>`? Why is it useful to
   permit such conversion, and what are the risks in doing so unconditionally?

5. Why is `MakeUnique` useful? Can't it be replaced with just invoking the `Span::Span`
   constructor?

6. What are some other examples of features from future C++ versions that have been backported
   as utility features in the Bitcoin Core codebase?
