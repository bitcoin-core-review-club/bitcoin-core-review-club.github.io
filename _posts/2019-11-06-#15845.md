## Notes

- [BIP 158](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0158.mediawiki)
  defines _compact block filters_: compact representations of data in a block.
- Compact block filters use Golomb-Rice coding for compression and can give a
  probabilistic answer to the question "does the block contain x?" There are no
  false negatives (if x is in the block, the answer will never be 'no'), but there are
  false positives (if x is not in the block, the answer may be 'yes'). The false
  negative rate is a parameter of the filter construction.
- BIP 158 also specifies one filter type called _Basic_ block filters, which
  encode the scriptPubKeys of all the UTXOs spent in the block, and the
  scriptPubKeys of all the new UTXOs created in the block.
- [PR 12254](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12254) implemented compact
  block filters in Bitcoin Core, and [PR
  14121](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14121) added a new index, which
  stores the compact block filters for blocks that have been validated.
- When rescanning, the wallet wants to know whether there are any transasctions
  that send outputs to addresses it owns or spends those outputs.
  Currently rescan is done by [iterating through every transaction in every
  block](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/6a7c40bee403cadedeecd4b1c6528575522094eb/src/wallet/wallet.cpp#L1611-L1613)
  (from the rescan start point).
- Rescanning the entire block chain can typically take half an hour or more.
- This PR changes the rescan logic to first compute a Golomb-Coded Set of all
  the wallet's scripts, and then tests for matches against all blocks in
  the block chain. Only blocks with a positive match need to be fetched and
  scanned by the wallet.
- This functionality can only be used if a compact block filter index has been
  constructed by the node. Use the `-blockfilterindex=1` argument.

## Questions

1. Did you review the PR? [Concept ACK, approach ACK, tested ACK, or
  NACK?](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#peer-review)
  (Don't forget to put your PR review on GitHub.)

2. What steps did you take, beyond reading the code?

3. How many scripts will a newly created wallet have? How many items will be
   added to the GCS returned by `GetAllRelevantScriptPubKeys()`?

4. What is the false-postive rate for Basic compact block filters? How many
   false positives blocks would you expect a newly created block to retrieve if
   scanning the entire block-chain? (note that newly-created keys have _birthdays_
   which mean they don't actually have to scan before the key was generated).

5. What do you think of the new tests? Would you add any additional test cases?
