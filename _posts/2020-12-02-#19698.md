## Notes

* Bitcoin script allows users to attach spending conditions to transaction
outputs. “Locking” scripts in transaction outputs specify some spending
condition (often a public key and signature) and “unlocking” scripts in
transaction inputs supply the operations and/or data to satisfy that
condition. Transaction validation includes interpreting these scripts and
running their specified operations such as verifying signatures, hashing data,
checking timestamps, etc.
* The Bitcoin script
[interpreter](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/2ee954daaee5758d04935492139808cb6fd95233/src/script/interpreter.cpp#L431)
includes code that understands all types of scripts and accepts
[script verification flags](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/2ee954daaee5758d04935492139808cb6fd95233/src/script/interpreter.h#L41)
to adjust which rules to enforce. Determining which flags to apply is very
important.
    -  Example 1: When a node validates a block, it determines what the
       consensus rules are (see
[GetBlockScriptFlags](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/04670ef81ea2300fcba4e1a492c4c6b0e0752848/src/validation.cpp#L1822),
which also serves as a little tour of Bitcoin consensus history) before
validation. During IBD, the relevant consensus rules may change very frequently.
    - Example 2: Bitcoin Core nodes also enforce
      [policy](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/tree/master/src/policy) (or
“standardness”) rules in addition to consensus rules when accepting transactions
into their mempool by applying [additional script verification
flags](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/2ee954daaee5758d04935492139808cb6fd95233/src/policy/policy.h#L58).
    - The `SCRIPT_VERIFY_DISCOURAGE_UPGRADEABLE_NOPS` policy flag prevents a
      node from accepting a transaction that uses an upgradeable OP_NOP into its
mempool. During activation for `CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY`, for example, an in-mempool
transaction using NOP2 could have been invalidated between blocks.
“Discouraging” transactions in this way is preferable to re-validating all
transactions in the mempool after every block.
    - PR [#10699](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10699) describes a
      procedure for adding new consensus rules via upgradable NOPs or witness
versions which incorporates this idea.
* PR [#10699](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10699) set the precedent
that all script verification flags must be soft forks, i.e. more script
verification flags = more strict spending rules.
* PR [#19698](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19698) extends the current
transaction unit tests by asserting that each test applies flags precisely by
asserting an opposite result when flags are removed or added. The goal is to
ensure that valid transaction tests don’t pass due to a lack of flags and
invalid transaction tests don’t fail due to an excess of flags.

## Questions

1. What is the difference between `PolicyScriptChecks` and
`ConsensusScriptChecks`?
2. Since the code for taproot is already in
interpreter.cpp, why aren’t taproot rules being enforced yet (what condition in
the code would it exit on)? How would we invoke `VerifyWitnessProgram` to make
it apply taproot spending rules?
3. This PR edits some of the
[CheckLockTimeVerify](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19698/files#diff-7e4229911841f1d419c71a0d0df95feb07b77f90c0ff39f09182eb8ca50779b9L196)
tests by removing the `1` (push a 1 to the stack) at the end of the scripts.
However, it doesn’t do this for all of them
([example](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19698/files#diff-7e4229911841f1d419c71a0d0df95feb07b77f90c0ff39f09182eb8ca50779b9L199)).
Why?
    (Hint: try removing it and running the transaction tests,
    `src/test/test_bitcoin --log_level=all --run_test=transaction_tests`)
4. What does
[TrimFlags](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/110239f2ff673eaea8f59c650792f3641855263d/src/test/transaction_tests.cpp#L138-L148)
do?
5. What does it mean for script verify
flags to be “minimal” and “maximal?”
6. How do the tests check that valid
transaction tests have maximal/minimal flags?
7. What does it mean for script verify
flags to be “soft forks?” How do the tests check this?
