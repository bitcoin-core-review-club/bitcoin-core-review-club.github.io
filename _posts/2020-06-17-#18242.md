title: "Add BIP324 encrypted p2p transport de-/serializer (only used in tests)"
pr: 18242
authors: [jonasschnelli]
components: ["p2p"]
host: ariard
status: upcoming

**Note:** in this PR Review club we will review the first three commits only
(`Expose MAC length in chacha_poly_ahead_h`, `Add BIP324 short-IDs to
protocol.h/.cpp` and `Add BIP324 v2 transport serializer and deserializer`).

## Notes

- Today's PR is part of the implementation of [BIP324: Version 2 Peer-to-Peer
  Message Transport
  Protocol](https://gist.github.com/jonasschnelli/c530ea8421b8d0e80c51486325587c52),
  proposed by Jonas Schnelli to improve privacy on the p2p network.

- Currently, P2P messages are transported in plaintext, which
  makes them vulnerable to eavesdropping by infrastructure entities such as
  ISPs. Such entities can tamper with, drop, or delay messages between anonymous
  peers. A malicious infrastructure entity could use this to influence the
  network topology, determine the origin of transactions, or perform attacks
  against off-chain protocols.

- BIP 324 is the second proposal for an encryption standard for the Bitcoin P2P
  network. The previous proposal ([BIP
  151](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0151.mediawiki)) was
  also authored by Jonas Schnelli and has been withdrawn.

- In BIP 324, messages are encrypted by the stream cipher
  [ChaCha20](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7539) with a Poly1305 [Message
  Authentication
  Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_authentication_code).

- A BIP 324 session starts with an [Elliptic Curve Diffie Hellman key
  exchange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic-curve_Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman)
  to establish a shared session key between peers (this key exchange is not yet
  implemented). From this shared sesssion secret, 2 keys, `K_1` and `K_2` are
  derived. `K_1` is used to encrypt the 3 bytes packet length. `K_2` is used to
  encrypt and authenticate the rest of the packet. Using symmetric keys `K_1` and
  `K_2`, the receiver first decrypts the length number and from this offset
  authenticates the packet. If authentication succeeds, the receiver decrypts the
  message payload and hands the content to the processing layer.

- Other PRs that are part of BIP 324 implementation:
  - [#15206: Immediately disconnect on invalid net message checksum](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15206) (discussed in a [previous Bitcoin Core PR Review Club](/15206))
  - [#15519: Add Poly1305 implementation](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15519)
  - [#15649: Add ChaCha20Poly1305@Bitcoin AEAD](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15649)
  - [#16202: Refactor network message deserialization](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16202)
  - [#16562: Refactor message transport packaging](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16562)

- [Jonas Schnelli's talk](https://github.com/kanzure/diyhpluswiki/blob/master/transcripts/breaking-bitcoin/2019/p2p-encryption.mdwn)
  at Breaking Bitcoin 2019 has additional information on BIP 324.

- A further step to prevent eavesdropping on the P2P network would be to add
  peer authentication, which is outside the scope of BIP 324. How to
  authenticate peers in an anonymous network is an [area of active
  research](https://gist.github.com/sipa/d7dcaae0419f10e5be0270fada84c20b).

## Questions

1. Did you review the PR? [Concept ACK, approach ACK, tested ACK, or
   NACK?](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#peer-review)
   (Don't forget to put your PR review on GitHub.)

2. What's your process to review a PR implementing a new BIP? Did you read the
   BIP or the code first? How can you ensure that BIP is correct? How can you ensure
   that code implements the BIP correctly?

3. BIP 324 introduces a new message structure, notably with short command ID.
   What do you think about those new short command ID?

4. Why was the Chacha20/Poly1305 construction chosen? Have you read Bitcoin
   Core implementations of these primitives?

5. Beyond code review, how can testing be improved? What failure cases should
   be tested?

6. Could the serialization/deserialization code be better documented or
   simplified? Consider the choices of data structures and algorithms.
