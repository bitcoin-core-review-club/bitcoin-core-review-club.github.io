## Notes

- Bitcoin transactions encode spending conditions through a _scriptPubKey_ in outputs and a _witness_
  and _scriptSig_ in the inputs. You can read more about Bitcoin Script
[here](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Script). In the functional test framework, scripts are represented
using the
[CScript](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/2749613020ed96a4e9204f8b98c44524b0a62d0d/test/functional/test_framework/script.py#L423)
class, and can be initialized using an array of opcodes and byte-encoded data.

- PR [#22363](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22363) replaces many manually-constructed
  default scripts in the functional tests with helper functions provided in `script_util.py`.
It also corrects an error in the helper function,
[`get_multisig`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22363/files#diff-cc5214ad594f50da8e14449daae7f8cff3e8d385c623b1ca13efeb3e5ca0446bR86),
in which the P2SH-wrapped P2WSH script hadn't hashed the witness script before putting it into the
scriptSig. We'll use this opportunity to review script and output types.

- To test your understanding of scripts and output types, you can try to fill out this table (Hint:
  a few cells have been pre-filled, and some cells should remain blank):

We will fill out this table throughout the review club, and solutions will be posted after the
meeting.

## Questions

1. Did you review the PR? [Concept ACK, approach ACK, tested ACK, or
NACK](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#peer-review)?

2. What do `key_to_p2pkh_script`, `script_to_p2sh_script`, `key_to_p2wpkh_script` and
    `script_to_p2wsh_script` in script\_util.py do? In what cases would we want to use or not use them?

3. Review of Terminology: Let's define script code, witness script, redeem script, scriptPubKey,
    scriptSig, witness, and witness program (some of these terms are synonymous).

4. What does the operation `OP_HASH160` do? (Hint: what does the [script
interpreter](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/2749613020ed96a4e9204f8b98c44524b0a62d0d/src/script/interpreter.cpp#L431)
    do when it sees this opcode? What are the differences between the
[hashers](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/2749613020ed96a4e9204f8b98c44524b0a62d0d/src/hash.h)?)

5. Review of P2PKH: to send coins to someone by public key hash (pre-segwit), what is included in
    the scriptPubKey of the output? What needs to be provided in the input when the coin is spent?

6. Review of P2SH: to send coins to someone with spending conditions encoded in a script, what is
    included in the scriptPubKey of the output? What needs to be provided in the input when the coin is
    spent? Why do we use Pay-To-Script-Hash instead of Pay-To-Script?

7. Review of P2SH-P2WSH: What is the purpose of "P2SH wrapped segwit" outputs? When a non-segwit
    node validates a P2SH-P2WSH input, what does it do?

8. Review of P2SH-P2WSH: When a node with segwit enabled validates a P2SH-P2WSH input, what does it
    do _in addition to_ the procedure performed by a non-segwit node?

9. What is wrong with the P2SH-P2WSH script
[here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/091d35c70e88a89959cb2872a81dfad23126eec4/test/functional/test_framework/wallet_util.py#L109)?
    (Hint: which variable holds the 2-of-3 multisig script itself? Which variable holds the scriptSig
    which will be included in the input?)

10. How would you verify the correctness of helper functions like `get_multisig()`? Can we add tests
    for them?

11. Can you find any other places in functional tests that could use the script\_util.py helper
    functions instead of manually creating scripts?
