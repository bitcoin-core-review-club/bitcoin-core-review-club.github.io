## Notes

- A _soft fork_ is a forwards-compatible change to the Bitcoin consensus rules.
  Any block or transaction that was invalid for nodes that don't implement the
  new soft fork rules will be invalid for nodes that _do_ implement the soft
  fork rules.

- There have been many consensus changes in Bitcoin's 12 year history. A [BitMEX
  research blog post](https://blog.bitmex.com/bitcoins-consensus-forks/) lists
  those consensus changes.

- Changing Bitcoin's consensus rules requires coordination across a decentralized
  network. We want as close as possible to 100% of economic nodes to be
  start enforcing the new consensus rules and as close as possible to 100% of
  miners to be mining valid blocks acording to the new consensus rules.

- There have been several different methods to coordinate these changes to the
  consensus rules:

  - Flag day upgrades were used to activate early consensus rules changes.
    Developers simply chose a time after which the new rules would be enforced.

  - IsSuperMajority was used for three changes to the consensus rules between
    2012 and 2015. This activation method is described in [BIP
    34](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0034.mediawiki#specification).

  - Version Bits was used to activate two changes to the consensus rules between
    2015 and 2017. The method is described in [BIP
    9](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0009.mediawiki).

  A [draft Optech topic
  page](https://deploy-preview-531--bitcoinops.netlify.app/en/topics/soft-fork-activation/)
  provides an excellent summary of the history of activation methods.

- Once a change to the consensus rules has been activated and buried under many
  months or years of work, the soft fork activation height is established fact.
  We assume that a competing fork of the chain will not re-org back to before the
  activation and change the activation height.

- At that point, the exact method of activation is no longer interesting, and
  any logic in the node that enforces that activation method is technical debt.
  We can hard code the activation height into the node's logic. This is called
  'burying' the deployment method, and is documented in [BIP
  90](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0090.mediawiki).

- [Bitcoin Core PR 8391](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8391) buried
  the IsSuperMajority soft fork deployments (BIP 34, BIP 65, and BIP 66). [PR
  16060](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16060) later buried the version
  bits soft fork deployments (CLTV and segwit).

- Both of those PRs required changing multiple code paths in the validation
  logic. In a [review
  comment](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11398#issuecomment-335599326),
  Pieter Wuille suggested abstracting out the difference between a soft fork
  activation and buried deployment, so that burying deployments in future wouldn't
  require so many changes to different code paths.

- This PR does exactly that, by introducing
  `Deployment{ActiveAfter|ActiveAt|Enabled}` functions that are defined for both
  version bits deployments and buried deployments.
