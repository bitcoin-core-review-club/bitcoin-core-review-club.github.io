## Notes

### Motivation

- The goal of this PR is to refactor the code to enable removing the mempool's
  `NotifyEntryAdded` and `NotifyEntryRemoved` signals.

- These boost signals were added in
  [PR #9371](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17562) "Notify on removal",
  before Bitcoin Core had an asynchronous validation interface.

- The `NotifyEntryAdded` callback was used by validation to build a vector of
  conflicted transactions when connecting a block, which the wallet was notified
  of in the `BlockConnected` `CValidationInterface` callback.

- Now that we have an asynchronous `TransactionRemovedFromMempool` callback, we
  can fire that signal directly from the mempool for conflicted transactions
  without having to worry about the performance impact of synchronising wallet
  transactions during block connection.

### History

- [PR #3669](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3669) introduced the
  concept of conflicted transactions to Bitcoin Core in 2014:
```text
    This introduces the notion of a "conflicted" transaction -- a transaction created
    by the wallet that is not in either the blockchain or the memory pool, and that
    (therefore) is unlikely to ever be confirmed.

    In the RPC interface, these transactions were previously reported as confirmations: 0.

    With this change, they are reported as confirmations: -1 and category: "conflicted".

    So if a transaction is mutated or double-spent, and the mutated version ends up
    being mined, listtransactions will show both. Transactions can go from category
    conflicted to sent/received if a blockchain re-org happens.
```

### Visit

- To see the `Notifications` class in `src/interfaces/chain.h`
  ```
  git grep -A11 "Chain notifications"
  ```
- To see where a chain depth (confirmations) value of -1 is assigned for an
  `isConflicted?` state
  ```
  git grep -A7 "int CWalletTx::GetDepthInMainChain"
  ```
- To see the reasons, passed to the notifications, why a transaction can be
  removed from the mempool from the perspective of the codebase
  ```
  git grep -A7 "enum class MemPoolRemovalReason"
  ```

### Commit notes

- This PR makes changes in a methodical, step-by-step manner that is logical and
  clear to follow.

- In commit 1 of this PR, the same reasons we saw above for evicting a
  transaction from the mempool are added (and more clearly written) in
  `src/validationinterface.h:91: virtual void TransactionAddedToMempool`
  ```
  git grep -A17 "virtual void TransactionAddedToMempool(const CTransactionRef "
  ```

- Commit 1 aligns the `TransactionAddedToMempool` function with the
  `MemPoolRemovalReason` enum class (except *one* of the reasons... which one
  and why?) and removes the transaction conflict checks from the conditional in
  `src/txmempool.cpp:404: void CTxMemPool::removeUnchecked` and from
  `wallet/wallet.cpp:1099:void CWallet::BlockConnected`.

- Commit 2 logically proceeds to remove `vtxConflicted` from the parameters
  of all the `BlockConnected` functions.

- Commit 3 removes the `conflictedTxs` code from `class PerBlockConnectTrace`
  and `class ConnectTrace` in `src/validation.cpp`.

- Commit 4 removes the `NotifyEntryRemoved` callback code from `class
  ConnectTrace` in `src/validation.cpp`. Since `PerBlockConnectTrace` no longer
  tracks conflicted transactions, `ConnectTrace` no longer requires these
  notifications.

- Commit 5 completes the local cleanup by removing the `pool` member from
  `ConnectTrace` in `src/validation.cpp`.

- Finally, the last commit builds on the preparatory work in the preceding
  commits, which collectively enable the end goal of the PR: removing the
  `NotifyEntryAdded` and `NotifyEntryRemoved`.
