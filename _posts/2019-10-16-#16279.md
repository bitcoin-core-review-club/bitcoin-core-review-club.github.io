## Notes

- [`ProcessNewBlock()`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/f4d93078dde502bb6a77dcc94ac6eafe20e36324/src/validation.cpp#L3750)
  is net processing's entry point into validation, called whenever net
  processing receives a new block. It can be called in `ProcessMessage()` when
  a `BLOCK`, `CMPCTBLOCK` or `BLOCKTXN` message is received and net processing
  is ready to hand a block to the validation layer.
- `ProcessNewBlock()` calls `CheckBlock()` to carry out non-contextual
  validation tests on the block.  If those checks pass, then
  `ProcessNewBlock()` calls `AcceptBlock()`, which does more checks on the block
  and then stores it to disk.
- If `AcceptBlock()` passes and the block is valid, then `ActivateBestChain()`
  is called to update the node's view of the blockchain. If the new block has
  more work than the node's current tip, then `ActivateBestChain` will try to
  connect it to the chain and update the UTXO set. This can fail, for
  example if a transaction in the block spends non-existent coins.
- If a peer is sending us invalid blocks, then depending on the invalidity
  reason, we may wish to disconnect that peer.
- If either `CheckBlock()` or `AcceptBlock()` fails, then the failure reason
  will be saved in a `CValidationState` object and returned to
  `ProcessNewBlock()`.
- Prior to this PR, `ProcessNewBlock()` would then call the `BlockChecked` method
  in the `CValidationInterface`. net processing would receive the
  `BlockChecked` callback and then potentially disconnect the peer.
- This PR changes `ProcessNewBlock` so that if `CheckBlock()` or `AcceptBlock()`
  fail, then it will return the `CValidationState` directly to the caller, which
  can then decide whether to ban the peer.
- This PR is a step towards [PR
  16175](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16175), which makes
  `ProcessNewBlock()` asynchronous, and would allow parallelization between net
  processing and validation.

## Questions

1. Did you review the PR? [Concept ACK, approach ACK, tested ACK, or
  NACK?](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#peer-review)
  (Don't forget to put your PR review on GitHub.)

2. What steps did you take, beyond reading the code?

3. Did anything about the way new blocks are checked and accepted surprise you?
  Do you have any questions about the series of steps to add a block to the
  block chain?

4. The author describes this PR as _"a first step towards a series of cleanups
  leading to a (more-complete) #16175. It's just two rather-nice (IMO)
  cleanups."_ Do you agree? Is this _just_ a cleanup PR or are there behaviour
  changes?

5. Are there any other `CValidationInterface` clients that use the
  `BlockChecked` callback?

6. The other place that the `BlockChecked` method is called is in
  `ConnectTip()` in `ActivateBestChain()`. Why does that need to be a
  callback?  Why does net processing need to keep a `mapBlockSource` map from the
  block to the peer that provided it?
