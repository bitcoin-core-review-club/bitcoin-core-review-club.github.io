## Definitions

- A **package** is a group of transactions that have some dependency
  relationship, i.e., some transaction spends the outputs of another
  transaction in the package.  We might call a package a "transaction chain" when
  it has multiple generations of such dependencies.

- A **test accept** of validation refers to an invocation of mempool validation
  that validates but does not submit a transaction to the mempool, called from
  the `testmempoolaccept` RPC.

- **Coins** ([`CCoins`](https://doxygen.bitcoincore.org/struct_c_coin.html))
  are UTXOs.  In our context, coins don't necessarily need to exist on-chain;
  they can be outputs from transactions in the mempool or some other valid but
  unconfirmed transaction.  A **Coins View** is a data structure that contains
  the available coins. The typical usage is to query a Coins View with a
  `COutPoint`.

## Background

- The `testmempoolaccept` RPC was introduced in
  [#11742](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11742) and allows users to
  test raw transactions for validity. While the return object is an array (with
  the intention to allow multiple transactions), `testmempoolaccept` is currently
  limited to one transaction at a time, which means users cannot test
  transactions that depend on outputs that the mempool has not seen yet. The main
  reason for this limitation is that our validation code only uses the coins
  available in the current chain state and mempool (and not anything else), to
  validate transaction inputs.

- Another reason package mempool accept may be of interest is to improve fee
  bumping.  Currently, Child Pays for Parent does not work for transactions
  with a feerate below the mempool minimum fee, which can be dangerous for
  recipients of time-sensitive transactions.
  [#20833](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/20833) is a first step towards
  package validation and hopefully, eventually, [Package
  Relay](https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/package-relay/).  We have discussed
  Package Relay in a previous review club,
  [#16401](https://bitcoincore.reviews/16401).

  [here](https://brink.dev/blog/2021/01/21/fellowship-project-package-accept/).

## Notes

- [#20833](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/20833) enables dry runs of
  package validation.  It does this by having `CCoinsViewMemPool` keep track of
  the Coins created and spent by transactions in the package.

- The
  [`MemPoolAccept`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/7f653c3b/src/validation.cpp#L451)
  class represents a "validation session" with the current mempool and chain
  state; it holds `cs_main` and `pool.cs` mutexes throughout validation.  Its job
  is to figure out whether a transaction (received from peers or clients like
  RPC) is a valid candidate for submission to the mempool.  To do so, it applies
  consensus and
  [policy](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/tree/c831e105/src/policy) rules.
  Importantly, if a transaction is invalid, `MemPoolAccept` is designed such that
  it fails as quickly as possible to mitigate DoS risks.

- Each `MemPoolAccept` instance creates a Coins View from the current chain tip
  and mempool.  `CCoinsView` is a class with a hierarchical structure (see
  diagram below).

```
             +--------------------+
             |                    |
             |     CCoinsView     |
             |                    |
             +----------+---------+
                        ^
                        |
             +----------+---------+
             |                    |
             |  CCoinsViewBacked  |
             |                    |
             +------+------+------+
                    ^      ^
           +--------+      +--------+
           |                        |
+----------+---------+  +-----------+---------+
|                    |  |                     |
|  CCoinsViewCache   |  |  CCoinsViewMemPool  |
|                    |  |                     |
+--------------------+  +---------------------+
```

- A `CCoinsViewBacked` points to another `CCoinsView` as its "backend." When
  `CCoinsViewBacked.GetCoin()` cannot find a coin in its own data structures,
  it calls `backend.GetCoin()` to continue searching. Thanks to the magic of
  polymorphism, `CCoinsViewBacked` Coins Views can be "layered" to allow
  searching for coins in multiple locations without changing the underlying chain
  state.

- Since the UTXO set is quite large and stored on disk, Bitcoin Core uses a
  cache to improve validation performance.  To prevent cache thrashing caused
  by an attacker broadcasting many invalid transactions spending a wide variety
  of UTXOs (a cheap DoS attack), we keep track of which Coins are brought in from
  disk and uncache them if the transaction turns out to be invalid.

- Validation roughly consists of `PreChecks`, `PolicyScriptChecks`,
  `ConsensusScriptChecks`, and `Finalize`.  We've touched on these functions in
  previous review clubs, e.g.  [#19339](https://bitcoincore.reviews/19339).  This
  [Stack Exchange
  post](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/100317/what-is-the-difference-between-policy-and-consensus-when-it-comes-to-a-bitcoin-c)
  about consensus vs policy rules may also be helpful.

- In an effort to not make any API-breaking changes, #20833 returns a `results`
  array with one result per transaction in the same order they were passed in
  or the first failure result.

## Questions

1. Did you review the PR? [Concept ACK, approach ACK, tested ACK, or
   NACK](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#peer-review)?

2. What are some use cases for enabling packages through `testmempoolaccept`?

3. What are some limitations of this implementation of package validation?

4. From a code niceness standpoint, what is the benefit of moving the
   validation state, replaced transactions, and fee to `Workspace`?  Should we
   add `coins_to_uncache` to `Workspace` and make `ATMPArgs` a const? Why or why
   not?

5. Why do we run all `PreChecks` before script checks? Would it still be
   correct if we didn't do this?

6. In
   [AcceptSingleTransaction](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/574758e6/src/validation.cpp#L1037)
   (with `test_accept=true`), both `PolicyScriptChecks` and
   `ConsensusScriptChecks` are run. However, in
   [AcceptMultipleTransactions](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/574758e6/src/validation.cpp#L1068),
   we don't run `ConsensusScriptChecks`. Why is that okay?  (Followup question:
   why do we run `ConsensusScriptChecks` at all in ATMP?)

7. When we fetch a coin from `m_viewmempool`, what 4 places do we look and in
   what order? Why do we check `cache_package_remove` before
   `cache_package_add` in `CCoinsViewMemPool::GetCoin`?

8. If a block arrives while we're running `PreChecks`, do we have to worry
   about our `CoinsView` becoming inconsistent?

9. What do you think of commit
   [`fa19ec6`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/20833/commits/fa19ec6f98f0ae3398b0d3310f28cdbbfec7c653),
   which removes the line switching the `m_view` backend to `m_dummy`?  What kind
   of bug is it trying to prevent and how else are we trying to prevent such a
   bug?

10. What are your thoughts on the `results` array (returning one for each tx if
    successful or the first one if failed)? Do you have any suggestions for
    improvement, and is it API-breaking?
