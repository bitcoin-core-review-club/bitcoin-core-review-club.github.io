## Notes

An _eclipse attack_ is when an attacker is able to isolate a node from all honest
peers.

This PR seeks to mitigate a specific type of eclipse attack by introducing
anchor connections, which are peers that a node tries to reconnect to on
startup.

### Background

- [PR 15759](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15759) changed the
  peer-to-peer behavior to add two _blocks-only_ connections. We discussed
  this change in a [previous Review Club
  meeting](https://bitcoincore.reviews/15759.html). I recommend you read
  the notes, questions and meeting log from that meeting if you're not
  already familiar with those changes.

- [Eclipse attacks](https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/eclipse-attacks/) occur
  when an adversary is able to isolate a victim's node from the rest of the
  network. We discussed eclipse attacks in previous Review Club meetings,
  including [the discussion on PR
  16702](https://bitcoincore.reviews/16702.html). If you're unfamiliar with the
  concept of eclipse attacks, [the Optech topics page](https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/eclipse-attacks/) and the notes from that
  meeting contain links to many resources on the subject.

- A _restart-based eclipse attack_ occurs when the adversary is able to add its
  own addresses to the victim's address manager and then force the victim to
  restart. If the attack succeeds, the victim will make all of its connections
  to the adversary's addresses when it restarts.

- [Issue 17326](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/17326) proposed
  persisting the node's outbound connection list to disk, and on restart
  reconnecting to the same peers. It's worth reading the full discussion in
  that issue, since there are a lot of subtle points around which peers
  should be persisted.

- This PR, [PR 17428](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17428) adds
  functionality to preserve outbound block-relay-only connections during
  restart.

### Issue 17326

- The most likely way for an eclipse attack to occur is by forcing a victim
  to restart and then making it connect only to malicious peers.

- In the 2015 implementation of Bitcoin Core, an attacker could carry out a
  "connection starvation attack". In this attack, the adversary fills up
  all of the available inbound connections on the network and then forces
  the victim to reboot. When the victim restarts, he's unable to connect to
  any honest peers on the network since their inbound connections slots are
  all filled up. Since anchor connections only help identify honest peers, not
  connect to them, they are not an effective mitigation strategy against such an
  attack.

- Since then, Bitcoin Core has implemented logic to sometimes rotate through
  incoming connections when the max number is hit. This means the victim has a
  way to successfully evict an attacker's connections to honest peers and
  reconnect to those honest peers.  While this means that it's possible for an
  attacker to eclipse a node without it rebooting, it also makes carrying out the
  eclipse attack more complex.

- Reconnecting to the same outgoing connections on restart makes the network graph more static. While
  this helps maintain longstanding honest connections and prevent an eclipse
  attack, this can have a negative effect on privacy since the network topology
  is easier to map.

- There are some other reasons that we might not want to anchor all connections:

    1. A victim of an eclipse attack has no way of escaping if all of his connections
       are anchored to the adversary.
    2. Strong persistence can contribute to the network self-partitioning. For
       example, if the longer distance connections are less reliable, nodes are
       incentivized to connect locally and this could lead to subgraphs per continent.
    3. An attacker could eclipse nodes with a small number of nodes but 100% uptime
       and a large capacity for inbound connections. Every time a node adds a
       connection to a new peer, if that peer is an adversary then it would be "locked in"
       forever with anchoring logic.

- The suggestion of using blocks-relay-only peers mitigates the concerns around
  reduced outbound peer rotation negatively impacting transaction privacy,
  while maintaing the benefit of mitigating from an eclipse attack.

### PR 17428

- The 2 outbound block-relay-only connections are written to the `anchors.dat`
  file. When a node restarts, it first tries establishing connections with the
  anchors before attempting to connect to other peers.

- Previously, a node that would quickly reattempt the same outgoing connections
  was detected as a spy or mass connector. The new behavior in this PR means that honest
  nodes will attempt the same outgoing connections more than once, which was
  unlikely before.

- The current state of this implementation introduces a new risk -- if one of the
  anchor peers is malicious and is able to exploit a remote crash vulnerability, they
  can repeatedly crash the victim's node. Every time the victim node restarts,
  it would connect to the same malicious anchor peer, which could force another
  remote crash.

  The proposed fix is to forget the anchor peers on an unclean exit.

  In reaction to these findings, the PR was [closed](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17428#issuecomment-583737058).
  The PR has subsequently been reopened since there are still advantages to
  preserving connections when restarting a node. The implementation of the
  proposed fix is yet to come.

## Questions

1. Did you review the PRs? [Concept ACK, approach ACK, tested ACK, or
NACK?](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#peer-review)
(Don't forget to put your PR review on GitHub.)

2. What is an eclipse attack?
  - How does an adversary eclipse a node?
  - What attacks can an adversary execute on the victim?
  - How does this PR mitigate the attack? What are some limitations of the proposed fix?

3. How does the anchors.dat file work?
  - When are peers persisted and removed?
  - When does the node ignore the contents of anchors.dat?
  - What are some implications of the timing of adding peers?

4. What are the conditions for adding an anchor?
  - Why do we only consider adding blocks-only peers as anchor peers?
  - What would be the issue of using normal (transaction & block relay) peers
    as anchors?
  - What are limitations of how this implementation chooses anchors?
  - Why limit to only 2 anchors?

5. With the current implementation of this PR, how could an adversary carry out
   an attack? How is this different from what an attacker would have to do
   currently?

6. What is the new risk that this implementation currently introduces? What are
   the tradeoffs of the proposed fix (yet to be implemented)? Do you think the
   changeset would still be worthwhile? Why?
