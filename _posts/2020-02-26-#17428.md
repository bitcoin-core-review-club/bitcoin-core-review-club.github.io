## Notes

_Preliminary notes below. Additional notes will be published on Monday, February 24._

- [PR 15759](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15759) changed the
  peer-to-peer behavior to add two _blocks-only_ connections. We discussed
  this change in a [previous Review Club
  meeting](https://bitcoincore.reviews/15759.html). I recommend you read
  the notes, questions and meeting log from that Review Club if you're not
  already familiar with those changes.

- [Eclipse attacks](https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/eclipse-attacks/) occur
  when an adversary is able to isolate a victim's node from the rest of the
  network. We discussed eclipse attacks in previous Review Club meetings,
  including [the discussion on PR
  16702](https://bitcoincore.reviews/16702.html). If you're unfamiliar with the
  concept of eclipse attacks, the Optech topics page and the notes from that
  Review Club link to many resources on the subject.

- A _restart-based eclipse attack_ occurs when the adversary is able to add its
  own addresses to the victim's address manager and then force the victim to
  restart. If the attack succeeds, the victim will make all of its connections
  to the adversary's addresses when it restarts.

- [Issue 17326](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/17326) proposed
  persisting the node's outbound connection list to disk, and on restart
  reconnecting to the same peers. It's worth reading the full discussion in
  that issue, since there are a lot of subtle points around which peers
  should be persisted.

- This PR, [PR 17428](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17428) adds
  functionality to preserve outbound block-relay-only connections during
  restart.
