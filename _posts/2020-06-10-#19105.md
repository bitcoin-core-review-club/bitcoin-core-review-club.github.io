## Notes

- This is the second in a series of PRs implementing the Coin Statistics
  Index. [#18000](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18000) provides
  an overview of the work and is used to keep track of the different PRs.

- The first PR in the series was [#19055](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19055),
  featured in PR review club [two weeks ago](https://bitcoincore.reviews/19055).
  If you haven’t seen it, it would be beneficial to read that
  conversation first. There are also some links to papers in the description
  that might help you understand the theoretical background of the algorithm
  better.

- Based on the feedback from the last session, the scope of [PR
  19055](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19055) has since been reduced.
  Today’s PR adds the Python implementation of `MuHash3072`
  which was originally in [#19055](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19055). 
  [#19055](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19055) now only adds the C++
  implementation.

- The previous session was more heavily focussed on conceptual understanding
  of the UTXO set statistics index project as a whole. This week, we'll focus on
  understanding the implementation of `MuHash3072` in Python.

- The next PR in the series is [#19145](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19145).
  It may be interesting to skip ahead to see how the code is used but
  if you participated in the previous review club session you have already seen
  some of that code.

- This PR follows the pattern to check the C++ implementation of an algorithm
  against the Python implementation of the same algorithm. Another
  [example of this pattern is Siphash](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/test/functional/test_framework/siphash.py). 

## Questions

- What is the API of `MuHash3072` in Python? Is it different from the C++
  implementation in [PR 19055](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19055)?

- There is a `numerator` and a `denominator` property in the Python
  implementation. Can you explain how these are used in MuHash on a high level?
  Where are they in the C++ implementation?

- ChaCha20 is used in MuHash. What are the properties of that algorithm? 

- What is ChaCha20 used for in particular in MuHash? Explain why this is needed.

- What does the `modinv` method do? What is it’s role in finalizing the hash
  (in the `digest` method)? 

- What are your thoughts [theStack’s suggestion to use Fermat’s little theorem](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19105#discussion_r433820249)
  in the code and the trade-offs involved?

- How do you like the test to verify parity with the unit test of the C++
  implementation? Would have done it differently? Should it be extended?
  Should it be moved to a different place?
