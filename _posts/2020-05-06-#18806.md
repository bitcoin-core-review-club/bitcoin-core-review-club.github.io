## Notes

- A [bloom filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom_filter) is a
  probabilistic data structure. It supports two operations:
  - _adding_ an element to the filter.
  - _querying_ an element from the filter.

- If an element has been previously added, then querying for the element will
  return _true_. If an element has not been added, then querying for the
  element may return _true_ or _false_. In other words, querying may return a
  _false positive_, but will never return a _false negitive_.

- See the [wikipedia page](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1795) for
  how a bloom filter is implemented with hash functions onto a bitfield. Note
  that the false positive rate depends on the size of the filter and the number
  of hash functions.

- [BIP 37](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0037.mediawiki)
  introduced a new method for [Simple Payment Verification
  (SPV)](https://bitcoin.org/en/operating-modes-guide#simplified-payment-verification-spv)
  clients to use bloom filters to track transactions that affect their addresses.
  BIP 37 was implemented in Bitcoin Core in [PR
  1795](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1795).

- Using the P2P messages defined in BIP 37, an SPV client can request that a
  full node send it transactions which match a bloom filter. The full node will
  then relay unconfirmed transactions that match the filter, and the client can
  request [merkle
  blocks](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/608359b071dac82a9cf33a6c9e01f87abfcb90eb/src/merkleblock.h#L127-L132),
  which only contain the transactions that match the filter.

- The SPV client chooses the bloom filter parameters (filter size, number of
  hashes and a 'tweak' for the hashes) and sends them to the node in a
  `filterload` message.

- The original implementation contained a logic bug. If the client sent a
  `filterload` message with a zero-sized filter, then the serving node could
  later attempt a divide-by-zero and crash when querying an element from the
  filter. See
  [CVE-2013-5700](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-5700)
  for further details.

- This bug was quietly fixed in [PR
  2914](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2914) without advertising the
  reason. That fix added the `isFull` and `isEmpty` booleans, which have proven
  to be confusing for developers.

- This [PR 18806](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18806) removes those
  `isFull` and `isEmpty` booleans and adds a more straightforward fix for the
  issue.

## Questions

1. Did you review the PR? [Concept ACK, approach ACK, tested ACK, or
   NACK?](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#peer-review)
   (Don't forget to put your PR review on GitHub.)

2. Why was the motivation for [PR
   2914](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2914) not made explicit?

3. Serving bloom filters is now disabled by default for full nodes. Why? What
   are some of the problems with BIP 37? What alternatives are there?

4. How is this PR tested? Are there any additional tests that could be added?
