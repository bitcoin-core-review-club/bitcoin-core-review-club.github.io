This is the third PR in our special series on the [BIP
157](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0157.mediawiki)
implementation. See the previous meetings on [PR 18877](/18877.html) and [PR
18960](/18960.html).

## Notes

- This PR adds support for the `getcfheaders` P2P message. You should familiarise
  yourself with the format of that message and the `cfheaders` response before
  reviewing the code changes. Both of those messages are defined in [BIP
  157](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0157.mediawiki#getcfilters).

- The `getcfheaders` message contains two fields: `StartHeight` (the height of
  the first block in the requested range) and `StopHash` (the hash of the last
  block in the requested range). The message handling code starts by deserializing
  those fields into `uint_32t` and `uint256` local variables, respectively.

- The `PrepareBlockFilterRequest()` helper function has its interface changed
  to accept `start_height` and a `max_height_diff` parameters.

- The `ProcessGetCFHeaders()` function calls a new method on the block filter
  indexer class called `BlockFilterTypeName()`.

- New tests are added to the `p2p_blockfilters.py` test file.

## Questions

- What happens if the `getcfheaders` message is malformed and we're not able
  to deserialize it? Try testing this for yourself and looking at the debug
  logs.

- What changes do we need to make to the `ProcessGetCFCheckPt()` function in
  this PR? Why?

- What data is the `LookupFilterHashRange()` function returning? Why don't
  we just return the block headers to the peer?

- How is the new functionality tested? Should any other tests be added?
