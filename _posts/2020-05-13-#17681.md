## Notes

- the
  [`sethdseed`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/5b24f6084ede92d0f493ff416b4726245140b2c1/src/wallet/rpcwallet.cpp#L3943)
  RPC creates a new [BIP
  32](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0032.mediawiki) HD seed for
  the wallet. The previous keys or seeds are no longer used to generate receive
  or change addresses.

- If more than 1000 receive addresses have been given out from the old HD seed,
  and then the wallet restored from an old backup, any keys after the first 1000
  will not be in the keypool look-ahead.

- Prior to this PR, if a new HD seed is generated, and subsequently funds are
  sent to the first 1000 addresses given out from the old HD seed, the keypool
  for the old HD seed would not top up, and any funds sent to keys after the
  first 1000 would not be added to the wallet.

- This PR keeps the HD seed in the wallet (as an `inactivehdseed`), and tops up
  the keypool as necessary when new funds are received. New receive addresses
  are derived from the new HD seed as before.
