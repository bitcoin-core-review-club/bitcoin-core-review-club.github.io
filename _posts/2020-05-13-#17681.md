## Notes

- the
  [`sethdseed`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/5b24f6084ede92d0f493ff416b4726245140b2c1/src/wallet/rpcwallet.cpp#L3943)
  RPC creates a new [BIP
  32](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0032.mediawiki) HD seed for
  the wallet. The previous keys or seeds are no longer used to generate receive
  or change addresses.

- If more than 1000 receive addresses have been given out from the old HD seed,
  and then the wallet restored from an old backup, any keys after the first 1000
  will not be in the keypool look-ahead.

- Prior to this PR, if a new HD seed is generated, and subsequently funds are
  sent to the first 1000 addresses given out from the old HD seed, the keypool
  for the old HD seed would not top up, and any funds sent to keys after the
  first 1000 would not be added to the wallet.

- This PR keeps the HD seed in the wallet (as an `inactivehdseed`), and tops up
  the keypool as necessary when new funds are received. New receive addresses
  are derived from the new HD seed as before.

## Questions

1. Did you review the PR? [Concept ACK, approach ACK, tested ACK, or
   NACK?](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#peer-review)
   (Don't forget to put your PR review on GitHub.)

2. How does it help users to top up keypools for inactive HD seeds? What is not
   good about the behavior before this PR?

3. The original motivation for the PR was to remove the restriction that
   setting a new HD seed wasn't [allowed during Initial Block
   Download](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/769b03a83c2aa2b97f344b58dc689be26c6e08e5)?
   What was the reason for this restriction?

4. Why was the `sethdseed` RPC added? Are there uses for having multiple HD
   seeds in the same wallet? Does this change to `sethdseed` affect new
   [descriptor
   wallets](https://github.com/achow101/bitcoin/blob/desc-wallet-followup/doc/release-notes-16528.md)
   as well as existing wallets?

5. The main data structures used in this PR are
   [`CHDChain`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/review.17681.5/src/wallet/walletdb.h#L88),
   [`CKeyMetadata`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/review.17681.5/src/wallet/walletdb.h#L126),
   and
   [`KeyOriginInfo`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/review.17681.5/src/script/keyorigin.h#L11).
   What are the purposes of the different data structures?

6. After the wallet has seen a existing key being used, how does the wallet
   decide whether to "top up" and generate new keys? What factors determine
   whether the wallet does or does not top up? Are there differences here
   between the new
   [`TopUpInactiveHDChain`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/review.17681.5/src/wallet/scriptpubkeyman.cpp#L293)
   method and existing
   [`TopUp`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/review.17681.5/src/wallet/scriptpubkeyman.cpp#L1194)
   method?

7. When is
   [`AddInactiveHDChain`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/review.17681.5/src/wallet/scriptpubkeyman.cpp#L902)
   called? Where do the inactive hd chain objects come from? Is
   `AddInactiveHDChain` called everywhere it needs to be called?

8. How is the PR structured and divided up? Would it make sense to split up or combine commits?

9. An [earlier
   version](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/commits/review.17681.1) of
   this PR tried (the implementation was buggy) to store
   [`m_inactive_hd_chains`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/review.17681.1/src/wallet/scriptpubkeyman.h#L301)
   map entries as
   [`"inactivehdchain"`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/review.17681.1/src/wallet/walletdb.cpp#L32)
   rows in the wallet database. Was it good to stop doing this? What are advantages of
   storing this information? What are the advantages of not storing it?

10. A [previous
   version](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/commits/review.17681.4) or
   this PR had a subtle bug on [this
   line](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/review.17681.4/src/wallet/walletdb.cpp#L446).
   What was the bug and what were the effects?

11. Is test coverage in this PR good? Are there ways the test could be extended?
