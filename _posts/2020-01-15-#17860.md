## Notes

- Implementing consensus in software is a hard problem and easy to get wrong. Both review and numerous forms of testing
  can be used to increase confidence that the consensus rules were properly implemented and don't change or regress
  accidentally.

- Bitcoin Core uses fuzz testing and has a bunch of fuzz targets for low level
  parsing and serialization or script evaluation. However, high level fuzz
  targets for net processing and validation are missing.

- There is [documentation on how to compile with AFL and libFuzzer on
  Linux](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/fuzzing.md). Other
  fuzz engines might work, but are currently undocumented.  According to [this
  GitHub
  comment](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/17657#issuecomment-562869600)
  it might be possible to run libFuzzer on macOS.


- [CVE-2018-17144](https://bitcoincore.org/en/2018/09/20/notice/) was found by code review, not by an automated test.
  However, this CVE can also be discovered with a fuzz test.

  Survey](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.00140.pdf), [CppCon 2017: Kostya Serebryany “Fuzz or

## Questions

1. Did you review the PR? [Concept ACK, approach ACK, ACK \<commit\>, or
  NACK?](https://github.com/jonatack/bitcoin-development/blob/master/how-to-review-bitcoin-core-prs.md#peer-review)&nbsp;
  Don't forget to put your PR review on GitHub or [ask
  questions](https://github.com/jonatack/bitcoin-development/blob/master/how-to-review-bitcoin-core-prs.md#ask-questions).

2. What is the difference between black-box and white-box fuzzing? Which technique does Bitcoin Core use? Refer to "The
   Art, Science, and Engineering of Fuzzing: A Survey" in the notes.

3. Did you compile the new fuzz target and run the fuzzer?

4. How can CVE-2018-17144 be exploited? Can you explain conceptually how to create an example block that exploits the
   bug?

5. What does the new fuzz test do on a high level? What "Actions" can it run?

6. On a low level, the fuzz test reads bytes from a given seed via the FuzzedDataProvider. Integral values
   are read from individual bytes starting at the end of the seed. Take a look at the [example
   seed](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/qa-assets/blob/1651d6c754097613bac0fb9f1092b5c623e046d9/fuzz_seed_corpus/utxo_total_supply/f66a2f2925ab9d377ea5c18ba941e7d1601b7509)
   (`zzzii`, without a new line) in the `qa-assets` repo. How many blocks are mined? Either explain by looking at the
   seed and code or obtain the result by modifying and running the fuzz test on the seed.

7. How can the fuzz target be tested for accuracy? Hint: How would you modify the Bitcoin Core source code to trigger
   the CVE? See also this pull request: [consensus: Explain why fCheckDuplicateInputs can not be skipped and remove
   it](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17080/files)

8. Could you find a seed that triggers the CVE? You can either create it manually, if you found an answer to question 4,
   or you can let the fuzzer run until it hits an assertion. If you let the fuzzer run: Was it successful? If not, what
   is the bottleneck of the fuzz test and could it be improved?
