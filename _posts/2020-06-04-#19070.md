This is the third PR in our special series on the [BIP
157](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0157.mediawiki)
implementation. See the previous meetings on [PR 18877](/18877.html), [PR
18960](/18960.html) and [PR 19010](/19010.html).

## Notes

- This PR adds support for the `NODE_COMPACT_FILTERS` service bit, used in
  `version` and `addr` messages to signal a node's capabilities. The existing
  service bit are
  [defined in protocol.h](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/5879bfa9a541576100d939d329a2639b79d9e4f9/src/protocol.h#L270-L300).

- Prior to this PR, even if a node is configured to serve `cfilter`,
  `cfheaders` and `cfcheckpts` messages, it won't signal that capability to
  peers on the network.

- This PR includes two important changes from the original implementation
  in [PR 16442](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16442):

  - `PrepareBlockFilterRequest()` no longer calls
    `BlockUntilSyncedToCurrentChain()` to avoid blocking the message handler
    thread.

  - `-peerblockfilters` can be set and `NODE_COMPACT_FILTERS` can be signaled
    before the index is fully built.

  See [the
  justification](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19070#issuecomment-634142901)
  for those changes and [jimpo's
  response](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19070#issuecomment-634940156)
  in the PR. See also [the
  summary](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19070#issuecomment-634974738)
  of prior discussion in PR 16442.

## Questions

- What are the implications of `PrepareBlockFilterRequest()` calling into
  `BlockUntilSyncedToCurrentChain()`? What are the implications of not calling
  `BlockUntilSyncedToCurrentChain()`? Which is preferable? Are there any
  alternative solutions?

- What are the potential problems with a node signaling `NODE_COMPACT_FILTERS`
  before its compact block filters index is built? What are the potential
  issues if a node changes its service bits dynamically?
