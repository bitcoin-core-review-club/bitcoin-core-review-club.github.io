## Notes

- Transaction relay is a three step process: `inv` -> `getdata` -> `tx`:

  1. the relaying node sends an `inv` message to the receiving node to announce
     a new transaction.
  2. if the receiving node wants to retrieve the transaction that it learned 
     about in the `inv` message then it will send a `getdata` message to the 
     relaying node to request the full transaction. (The receiving node wont 
     send a `getdata` message to a peer for transactions that it has already 
     seen or if it has already sent a `getdata` message for the transaction to 
     a different peer.)
  3. the relaying node delivers a `tx` message to the receiving node. If the
     relaying node is no longer able to deliver the transaction, it responds
     with `notfound` instead of the `tx`.

  You can learn more about these messages [here](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Protocol_documentation#inv).

- Currently if a `tx` message is received it will not be processed if:

   1. The node is in blocks-only mode and the peer sending the message has 
   no relay permissions
   2. The peer is a blocks-relay only peer

  Otherwise, the node checks if it has already processed this transaction before 
  using the [`AlreadyHaveTx()`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/9f3ffa29389aa59ea87b5aa974a2da17ccfd31a4/src/net_processing.cpp#L1619-L1648) 
  checks and if it not then the transaction is processed by [`AcceptToMemoryPool()`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/9f3ffa29389aa59ea87b5aa974a2da17ccfd31a4/src/validation.cpp#L1083-L1086).
  This is done even if it has not made a request for that transaction 
  (i.e: If it recieves a `tx` message without having first sent a `getdata` 
  message asking for the `tx` message then it will still process the transaction). 
  In other words the 3 step process described above is not enforced.

- This PR aims to change that by requiring a transaction to first be requested
  by a node before it processes an accociated `tx` message.

- The PR author provides additional motivation for the PR and raises some of the
  concerns that this change brings about in a [mailing list thread](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2021-February/018391.html).

## Questions

1. Did you review the PR? [Concept ACK, approach ACK, tested ACK, or
   NACK?](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#peer-review)

2. What is the `TxRequestTracker` class in [src/txrequest.h](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/b805dbb0b9c90dadef0424e5b3bf86ac308e103e/src/txrequest.h) used for?

3. What are the different states that a peer/tx “announcement” can be in? Where
   in the code is an announcement shifted between the different states?

4. What does the author claim the problem is with the current way in which 
   transaction messages are handled?

5. What is the change that this PR is making and how does it solve the problem
   mentioned in Q4?

6. When checking the `TxRequestTracker` to see if the node has requested a 
   transaction, why are both the transaction's `txid` and `wtxid` identifiers used?
   (hint: See [PR 19569](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19569) for details
   on fetching orphan parents from wtxid peers)

7. There are a lot of switches on the `PF_RELAY` flag in code relevant to this
   PR. What does the `PF_RELAY` flag mean? In what case(s) would you want to set
   this flag for a peer?

8. Discussion: Since the `inv` -> `getdata` -> `tx` sequence has not been necessary
   for communicating and receiving transaction data, some other clients don't
   bother with the sequence at all. This means that  if this change was deployed
   to Bitcoin Core nodes then other clients would not be able to relay transactions
   to upgraded Bitcoin Core nodes. Eventually upgraded nodes would make up the 
   majority of the network, and so those clients would have to adapt and update. 
   Do the pros out weigh these cons? And if so, what is fair time frame to allow for 
   the other clients to adapt?
