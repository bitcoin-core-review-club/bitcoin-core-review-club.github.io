## Notes

* A transaction's fee is not set explicitly. The fee can be implicitly
  calculated from the difference between total input value and the total output
  value.

* This PR updates the `getblock` RPC to include an extra "fee" field for transactions whenever:

    - `verbosity >= 2`
    - Undo data (which can be used for efficient fee calculation) exists for that block

* We discussed block undo data and how it's stored on disk in [a previous review club meeting](/17994).

* Some extra changes were added to prevent fuzz test failures; we discussed
  fuzz testing and how it's used in Bitcoin Core in [a previous review club
  meeting](/17860).

## Questions

1. What is `CTxUndo`?

    - How are we using it for fee calculation?
    - Where else is it used?
    - Why doesn't a coinbase transaction have Undo data?

2. What's the IO cost to read Undo data for a block?

3. How could we calculate the fee if Undo data didn't exist for a block, and
   what's the IO cost?

    - If there's a txindex?
    - If there's no txindex?

4. What does `CHECK_NONFATAL` do?

    - What other options are there (e.g. asserts), and when should we use each
      option?

5. Knowing the transaction fee is useful, but does only returning it in some
   circumstances actually provide a better client experience, or is it
   preferable for clients to always get exactly what they expect?

    - Should we also calculate the fee if Undo data is missing but a `txindex`
      is available?

6. At the moment, the fact that we might return "fee" is undocumented. Is it
   worth increasing the complexity of the documentation to say "we SOMETIMES
   return the fee; here's when we do so"?

7. We add some extra checks to prevent integer overflow in fuzz tests. But does
   it make sense for fuzz tests to generate inputs that violate function
   preconditions?
