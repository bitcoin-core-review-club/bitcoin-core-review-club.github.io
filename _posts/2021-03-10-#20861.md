In this PR Review Club meeting, we'll discuss
[BIP350](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0350.mediawiki) and
Bech32m. 

## Notes

- An **invoice address** (aka output address, public address, or just address),
  not to be confused with public key, IP address, or P2P Addr message, is a
string of characters that represents the destination for a Bitcoin transaction.
Since users generate these addresses to send bitcoins and incorrect addresses
can result in unspendable coins, addresses include checksums to help detect
human errors such as missing characters, swapping characters, mistaking a q for
a 9, etc.

- [Bech32](https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/bech32/) was introduced in
  [BIP173](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0173.mediawiki) as a
new standard for native segwit output addresses.
For more background on Bech32, this
[video](https://youtu.be/NqiN9VFE4CU) describes Bech32 checksums and their
error correction properties.

- Bech32 had an [unexpected
  weakness](https://github.com/sipa/bech32/issues/51), leading to the
development of Bech32m, described in
[BIP350](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0350.mediawiki).

- PR [#20861](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/20861) implements BIP350
  Bech32m addresses for all segwit outputs with version 1 or higher. Note that
such outputs are not currently supported by mainnet so this does not pose a
compatibility problem for current users.  It intentionally breaks forward
compatibility for future software to prevent accidentally sending to an
unspendable v1 output. 


## Questions

1.  Did you review the PR? [Concept ACK, approach ACK, tested ACK, or
NACK](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#peer-review)?
What was your review approach? 

2. Can you describe the length extension mutation issue found in Bech32? Does
it affect Bitcoin addresses? Why or why not?

3. How does Bech32m solve this length extension mutation issue?

4. Which addresses will be encoded using Bech32, and which ones with Bech32m?
How does this effect the compatibility of existing software clients?

5. What are the three components of a Bech32m address encoding?

6. How does
[`Decode`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/835ff6b8568291870652ca0d33d934039e7b84a8/src/bech32.cpp#L168)
check whether an address is encoded as Bech32 or Bech32m? Can a string be valid
in both formats?

7. The space in [this test
string](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/835ff6b8568291870652ca0d33d934039e7b84a8/src/test/bech32_tests.cpp#L80)
is not an accident. What does it test?

8. For fun: Is Bech32 case-sensitive? (Hint: Why is
["A12UEL5L"](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/835ff6b8568291870652ca0d33d934039e7b84a8/src/test/bech32_tests.cpp#L16)
valid but
["A12uEL5L"](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/835ff6b8568291870652ca0d33d934039e7b84a8/src/test/bech32_tests.cpp#L69)
not?)
