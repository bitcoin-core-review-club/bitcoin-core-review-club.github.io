## Notes

In this review club, we'll focus on the [second commit from this
branch](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/commit/aa4d626)
*(multiprocess: Add basic spawn and IPC support).* IPC here is an acronym for
[Inter-process
communication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter-process_communication).

The key things this commit adds are an [`IpcProcess::spawn()`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/pr/ipc-echo.7/src/interfaces/ipc.h#L24-L26) method, which a bitcoin parent process can call to spawn a new child process, and an [`IpcProcess::serve()`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/pr/ipc-echo.7/src/interfaces/ipc.h#L31-L33) method, which a bitcoin child process can call [after](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/pr/ipc-echo.7/src/bitcoind.cpp#L180-L185) [startup](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/pr/ipc.120/src/bitcoin-wallet.cpp#L82-L88) to communicate back to its parent process.

In follow-up PR [#10102 Multiprocess bitcoin](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10102), this functionality is used so a `bitcoin-gui` process can spawn a `bitcoin-node` process, and a `bitcoin-node` process can spawn a `bitcoin-wallet` process, and GUI, node, and wallet functionality can run in separate processes that are protected from each other. In further follow-ups [#19460 Add bitcoin-wallet -ipcconnect option](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19460) and [#19461 Add bitcoin-gui -ipcconnect option](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19461), more flexibility is added so node, wallet, and GUI processes can be started and stopped independently.

All communication between Bitcoin Core processes happens through [internal C++ interfaces](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/tree/f4cfa6d/src/interfaces), which are just C++ classes with pure virtual methods. The virtual methods allow bitcoin GUI, node, and wallet code to be written in a straightforward way that doesn't require dealing with complications of IPC. IPC is handled by the multiprocess framework added in this PR, to avoid the need to complicate application code with low level I/O.

Specifically, follow-up PR [#10102 Multiprocess bitcoin](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10102) uses the IPC framework added here to generate subclasses for each C++ interface class, with every overridden virtual method of every subclass implemented to send method calls and arguments to a remote process, wait for a response, and then return the response as the method return value. For example, if the GUI wants to find out if a wallet address is spendable, it calls the [`interfaces::Wallet::isSpendable()`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/pr/ipc.120/src/interfaces/wallet.h#L94-L95) method. If GUI code and wallet code are running in the same process, this directly invokes the [`interfaces::WalletImpl::isSpendable()` method implementation](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/pr/ipc.120/src/interfaces/wallet.cpp#L135). But if GUI and wallet code are running in different process, the multiprocess framework instead provides a different (generated) [`interfaces::Wallet`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/pr/ipc.120/src/interfaces/wallet.h#L51-L52) class implementation that forwards the method request and arguments to a remote wallet process, waits for the results, and returns them, instead of directly calling wallet code.

The design goal is for cross-process communication to happen through normal method calls, and for node, wallet, and GUI code not to have to change drastically to support process separation.

IPC framework support is added in the second commit [`aa4d626` Add basic spawn and IPC support](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/commit/aa4d626)
of [#19160](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19160), which is then tested in the third commit [`0602f87` Add echoipc RPC method and test](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/commit/0602f87) ([branch](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/commits/pr/ipc-echo.7)), and finally put to real use in [#10102 Multiprocess bitcoin](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10102) ([branch](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/commits/pr/ipc.120)). This review is focused on the second framework commit, and the 3 classes introduced there:

- `interfaces::IpcProcess` - [interface](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/pr/ipc-echo.7/src/interfaces/ipc.h#L14-L34), [implementation](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/pr/ipc-echo.7/src/interfaces/ipc.cpp#L18-L66)
- `interfaces::IpcProtocol` - [interface](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/pr/ipc-echo.7/src/interfaces/ipc.h#L36-L72), [implementation](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/pr/ipc-echo.7/src/interfaces/capnp/ipc.cpp#L37-L88)
- `interfaces::Init` - [interface](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/pr/ipc-echo.7/src/interfaces/init.h#L22-L51), [`bitcoind` implementation](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/pr/ipc-echo.7/src/interfaces/init_bitcoind.cpp#L13-L29), [`bitcoin-node` implementation](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/pr/ipc-echo.7/src/interfaces/init_bitcoin-node.cpp#L14-L42)

The [`IpcProcess`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/pr/ipc-echo.7/src/interfaces/ipc.h#L14-L34) class has [`spawn(exe_name, pid)`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/pr/ipc-echo.7/src/interfaces/ipc.h#L24-L26) and [`serve(exit_status)`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/pr/ipc-echo.7/src/interfaces/ipc.h#L31-L33) methods and is responsible for spawning new child processes, creating pipes child and parent processes can use to communicate, and passing pipe file descriptors to [`IpcProtocol`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/pr/ipc-echo.7/src/interfaces/ipc.h#L36-L72) objects in parent and child processes.

The [`IpcProtocol`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/pr/ipc-echo.7/src/interfaces/ipc.h#L36-L72) class is what actually sends method calls across the pipe, turning every method call into a request and a response, and tracking object lifetimes. The `IpcProcotol` and `IpcProcess` classes could have been melded together into a single class, but separating them allows the spawn and pipe setup code to work with protocols other than [Cap'n Proto](https://capnproto.org/), which is the internal protocol currently used by the `IpcProtocol` class.

The [`Init`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/pr/ipc.120/src/interfaces/init.h#L29-L61) interface is similar to other cross-process C++ interfaces like [`interfaces::Node`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/pr/ipc.120/src/interfaces/node.h#L45-L276), [`interfaces::Wallet`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/pr/ipc.120/src/interfaces/wallet.h#L51-L304), [`interfaces::Chain`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/pr/ipc.120/src/interfaces/chain.h#L60-L276) and [`interfaces::ChainClient`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/pr/ipc.120/src/interfaces/chain.h#L278-L309), providing virtual methods that can be called from other processes. What makes it special is that unlike other interfaces which are not implemented by every process—`interfaces::Node` is only implemented by the node process and `interfaces::Wallet` is only implemented by the wallet process—`interfaces::Init` is implemented by every process that supports being spawned, and it is the initial interface returned by the [`IpcProtocol::connect(fd)`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/pr/ipc-echo.7/src/interfaces/ipc.h#L50-L59) method, allowing the parent process to control the child process after the connection is established. The `interfaces::Init` interface has methods that allow the parent process to get access to every interface supported by the child process, and when the parent process frees the `interfaces::Init` object, the child process shuts down.

## Questions

1. The entry points for spawned [`bitcoin-node`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/pr/ipc-echo.7/src/bitcoind.cpp#L180-L185) and [`bitcoin-wallet`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/pr/ipc.120/src/bitcoin-wallet.cpp#L82-L88) processes both call [`IpcProcess::serve()`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/pr/ipc-echo.7/src/interfaces/ipc.h#L31-L33) then immediately exit when it returns. How do the child processes provide useful functionality to the parent processes if they never run the code after the `IpcProcess::serve()` calls?

1. When does the [`IpcProcessImpl::serve()`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/pr/ipc-echo.7/src/interfaces/ipc.cpp#L35-L61) method return true and when does it return false? Is it ever expected to return false, or is it always an error?

1. The [`IpcProcessImpl::spawn()`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/pr/ipc-echo.7/src/interfaces/ipc.cpp#L25-L33) implementation has a lambda that generates a vector of command line arguments for the process that should be spawned. What does the generated command line look like, and why does the generated command line for the child process depend on `m_argv[0]` of the parent process? Why does it include a pipe file descriptor (`int fd`).

1. The [`MakeCapnpProtocol(LocalInit& init)`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/pr/ipc-echo.7/src/interfaces/capnp/ipc.cpp#L91-L94) function returns an [`IpcProtocolImpl`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/0602f87a085c733f1da38b3b82210c81ef018fd5/src/interfaces/capnp/ipc.cpp#L37-L88) protocol implementation which is a dumb wrapper around [libmultiprocess](https://github.com/chaincodelabs/libmultiprocess/) functions that translate `interfaces::Init` method calls to pipe reads & writes (for a parent process) and translate pipe read & writes to `interfaces::Init` interface method calls (for a child process). If we wanted to replace libmultiprocess and use a different protocol to communicate across the pipe, would the [`interfaces::IpcProtocol`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/pr/ipc-echo.7/src/interfaces/ipc.h#L36-L72) interface need to change? If communication needed to go to a different channel other than a pipe, like an IP address, or an SSL socket, would the [`interfaces::IpcProtocol`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/pr/ipc-echo.7/src/interfaces/ipc.h#L36-L72) interface need to change then? How would it change?

1. The new [`init_bitcoind.cpp`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/pr/ipc-echo.7/src/interfaces/init_bitcoind.cpp) file introduced in this PR is linked into the `bitcoind` executable and the new [`init_bitcoin-node.cpp`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/pr/ipc-echo.7/src/interfaces/init_bitcoin-node.cpp) file is linked into the `bitcoin-node` executable. Without this change, and before this PR, the `bitcoind` and `bitcoin-node` executables were identical. In follow-up PR [#10102 Multiprocess bitcoin](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10102) there are more changes to [`init_bitcoind.cpp`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/pr/ipc.120/src/interfaces/init_bitcoind.cpp) and [`init_bitcoin-node.cpp`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/pr/ipc.120/src/interfaces/init_bitcoin-node.cpp) that give `bitcoin-node` significantly different behavior from `bitcoind`, running wallet code in a new spawned `bitcoin-wallet` process instead of in the same process. In this PR, the differences between `init_bitcoin-node.cpp` and `init_bitcoind.cpp` are more minor, but what are they? Do they lead to differences in observable behavior?

17:02 <jonatack> (hi also for ariard who is here)
17:02 <jonatack> y/n
17:02 <ryanofsky> Thanks, this is a big PR that and notes and questions there are about a portion of it, mostly meant to be a prompt
17:03 <michaelfolkson> I've looked at it but I feel as if I haven't :)
17:03 <ariard> y
17:03 <ryanofsky> Yeah we can start off with any questions you might have. No stupid questions and we can really talk about anything
17:04 <ryanofsky> Even "how does a pipe work?" general stuff not specific to bitcoin
17:04 <ryanofsky> Or just general difficulties or feedback
17:05 <ariard> okay wrt to the threading model, it's handle lower by libmultiprocess?
17:06 <ryanofsky> Threading is just supposed to be transparent
17:06 <ryanofsky> So if GUI calls a wallet method to find out the wallet balance, and the wallet is running in a different process
17:07 <ariard> the wallet process spwans a thread to serve ?
17:07 <ryanofsky> On the GUI process side, the getbalance method sends a requests, blocks, waits for a response, and then returns
17:08 <ryanofsky> Yes, and the wallet process sees that a call has come in from gui thread #234
17:08 <fjahr> I haven't studied capnp before. I remember seeing some discussion on it in the core dev irc. Is it worth re-reading any of that to get more of the context about it's use in core?
17:08 <ryanofsky> If it already has a thread to handle requests for #234, it runs calls the wallet getbalance method on that thread, otherwise it makes a new thread to handle that request and future ones
17:09 <ariard> and this service thread die with the connection?
17:09 <ryanofsky> ariard, yes, the service thread dies if the connection is closed
17:10 <lightlike> a very general q: what is the main goal for introducing multiprocesssing to core: Mostly architectural, i.e. is better separation of wallet/node/gui? or would it also affect performance?
17:10 <ryanofsky> it also dies if the thread #234 is joined before the connection is closed
17:11 <nehan> why are the threads short lived instead of long lived? presumably the wallet, gui, etc are going to run for a long time
17:11 <michaelfolkson> fjahr: I don't think capnp understanding is key to this https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10102#issuecomment-289999980
17:11 <ryanofsky> lightlike, there are different goals and tradeoffs. generally good for security, bad for performance, good for flexibility, like being able to have node run in backgground and attach/detach wallets and guis
17:11 <michaelfolkson> But yeah I haven't studied it either
17:12 <fjahr> michaelfolkson: but I want to understand it :)
17:12 <ryanofsky> what kinds of things do you want to know about capnp?
17:13 <ariard> memory separation, if your bitcoin-node gets corrupted, it won't be able to swallow your keys
17:13 <ryanofsky> it is basically a code generator, io frameowork, file format, and protocol
17:13 <ariard> also exposing interfaces means you can build tool against them
17:14 <michaelfolkson> lightlike: See the comments on this Slide 5 https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1AeJ-7gD-dItUgs5yH-HoEzLvXaEWe_2ZiGUUxYIXcws/edit#slide=id.g255500ac67_0_21
17:14 <ryanofsky> you could write a custom protocol, the advantage of using capnp is that when you want to add a new method or class or parameter, you just add it in a schema instead of having to write manual code
17:14 <fjahr> ryanofsky: no specific things about it, just if there is something worth reading on why it was chosen (i guess you chose it?) for this job
17:15 <lightlike> great thanks!
17:15 <ryanofsky> It was chosen just because I played with it an liked it. A similar alternative would be gRPC
17:16 <ariard> and also you can now move wallet/gui code in different repo, you don't have wallet utxo tracking meddle with validation
17:16 <fjahr> ryanofsky: that's good enough for me, thanks!
17:16 <ryanofsky> gRPC is lower lever, though, it doesn't track objects so requires more work to support bidirectional callbacks
17:17 <ryanofsky> in capnp each object has an identity, and you call a method on a specific object. while in gRPC you just define request and response formats and have to look up the objects yourself from the request
17:18 <michaelfolkson> Adding spawn support seems like it would be one of the final steps after untangling all the code between the different components. Is that all done now and ready to be merged?
17:18 <michaelfolkson> I can see the various open PRs
17:19 <ryanofsky> michaelfolkson, yes basically all that code is already merged
17:19 <michaelfolkson> Oh wow. This is further along than I thought it was then
17:19 <ryanofsky> all the code in the src/interfaces/ directory was introduce to define the interfaces between node, wallet, and gui components
17:21 <michaelfolkson> We can go through the questions you posed ryanofsky https://bitcoincore.reviews/19160.html
17:21 <ryanofsky> So this PR adds support for spawning, and then the next pr 10102 calls it to actually make bitcoin-node, bitcoin-gui, bitcoin-wallet processes specialize and talk to each other with the spawn support here
17:22 <jkczyz> Ah, so by "bidirectional", it doesn't simply mean returning data back from child to parent process but rather supporting callbacks from child to parent more generally
17:22 <ryanofsky> michaelfolkson, sure, one pre-question. The notes focused on IpcProcess, IpcProtocol, and Init classes introduced in this PR. We it clear what these classes do, and anyone want to summarize?
17:23 <ryanofsky> jkczyz, exactly yes, lots of interface methods take std::function arguments, or objects arguments
17:24 <ryanofsky> when a client passes a server a std::function or an object, the server can call back to that function or call an object method at any time, and the framework handles it
17:24 <nehan> ryanofsky: IpcProcess sets things up, IpcProtocol is used for the parent and child to actually talk to each other
17:25 <michaelfolkson> IpcProcess spawns new child processes
17:25 <ryanofsky> nehan, right, and one reason IpcProtocol is separate from IpcProcess, is so different protocols other than capnp could be supported in the future
17:26 <michaelfolkson> Child being a process that the parent process needs to complete a task right
17:26 <ryanofsky> michaelfolkson, right, it handles all the details of spawning and being spawned
17:26 <troygiorshev> ryanofsky: and init actually, er, holds everything?
17:26 <ryanofsky> michaelfolkson, right in 10102, bitcoin-gui spawns a bitcoin-node, and bitcoin-node spawns a bitcoin-wallet, so these are long running tasks
17:27 <nehan> is there some kind of architecture/picture diagram of the processes?
17:27 <troygiorshev> ^ +1
17:27 <michaelfolkson> So the child processes could be running continuously. The "parent" would be the process which is was running first
17:28 <troygiorshev> Something like the steps in init.h but for those of us who like pictures :)
17:28 <ryanofsky> troygiorshev, yes. Init does a few things but the main reason it exists is because the only way the framework allows processes to communicate by calling object methods, and Init is the object a spawned process provides to start off with
17:29 <ariard> nehan: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1AeJ-7gD-dItUgs5yH-HoEzLvXaEWe_2ZiGUUxYIXcws/edit#slide=id.p
17:29 <ryanofsky> No diagram exists, but a sequence diagram would be a good thing to have summarizing the init.h comment I agree
17:29 <michaelfolkson> I get why you want to be able to start/stop processes. But generally the processes would be running continuously and concurrently. They aren't going to be regularly stop/started?
17:31 <ryanofsky> michaelfolkson, maybe could be. Use cases I'm thinking of is you leave node running, but start and stop wallets, and start and stop gui
17:31 <michaelfolkson> Maybe they would... you only really need the node process running all the time
17:31 <nehan> ariard: saw that. doesn't have a diagram.
17:31 <ryanofsky> It's just an interesting thing you could do, though
17:32 <ryanofsky> So question 1 was just about the entry point line 180 in main(): https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/pr/ipc-echo.7/src/bitcoind.cpp#L180-L185
17:32 <nehan> in addition to what's described in init.h, it would be nice to see a diagram which shows the steps for the node, gui, and wallet. it's not obvious to me why the gui spawns a node and the node spawns the wallet?
17:33 <troygiorshev> related is, if the gui spawns a node, then does that mean we can't nicely shut down the gui without shutting down the node?  Or is the distinction between parent and child sortof flexible?
17:34 <ryanofsky> nehan, that's a good question. gui spawning node and node spawning wallet are just artifacts of the way the code works currently and are just supported so no user changes are required
17:34 <michaelfolkson> You mean the ordering doesn't make sense? What is the parent and the child in this context nehan?
17:34 <nehan> michaelfolkson: gui is parent to node, node is parent to wallet
17:35 <ryanofsky> yes. Should note that the parent/child relationships talked about with respect to spawning aren't some permanent part of the connections. Connections are fully bidirectional
17:35 <michaelfolkson> But the roles can be reversed right? The node can be the parent to the wallet. Just what happens in the general case
17:35 <ryanofsky> So if the node spawns a few wallets on startup, and some separate wallet processes are started which connect back to the node, all the wallets are equivalent
17:35 <nehan> ryanofsky: ah, thanks for clarifying
17:36 <thomasb06> https://capnproto.org/
17:37 <ryanofsky> I guess the first question was: How do the child processes provide useful functionality to the parent processes if they never run the code after the IpcProcess::serve() calls in main()?
17:38 <michaelfolkson> I didn't get this question :) I don't know why they would need to run the code *after* to be useful
17:39 <ryanofsky> michaelfolkson, good point
17:40 <troygiorshev> the communication is done, ultimately, through the fd used in serve.  Is that what this question is going for?
17:40 <ryanofsky> They definitely don't need to run code after. The question was assuming if you saw code in main that said if (condition) exit, you would might be suspicious
17:41 <ryanofsky> troygiorshev, yes. Answer is just that the serve method blocks and handles requests, so there is nothing to do when it exits
17:41 <ryanofsky> Probably bad question :) I definitely baked an assumption into it
17:42 <ryanofsky> Next question goes into the serve() implementation: https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/pr/ipc-echo.7/src/interfaces/ipc.cpp#L35-L61
17:42 <nehan> ryanofsky: i had trouble tracing through the code to answer this question. where is the block?
17:42 <michaelfolkson> Practise definitely makes perfect in all things (including PR review club hosting ;) )
17:42 <ryanofsky> yep getting close to perfection soon I think :)
17:43 <ryanofsky> nehan, yes, that's basically the question! the "if (init->m_process && init->m_process->serve(exit_status))" serve() call blocks
17:44 <nehan> here? https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/pr/ipc-echo.7/src/interfaces/capnp/ipc.cpp#L79
17:44 <lightlike> i thought that the protocol implementation (capnp) has a loop in its serve() method, so everything useful would happen during the IpcProcess::serve() call.
17:44 <troygiorshev> nehan: I was thinking Line 62 of that file
17:44 <ryanofsky> that line is saying "if I am a child process spawned to handle requests from a parent, and I am done handling requests, then exit without executing the rest of main()"
17:45 <ryanofsky> yes in this case it is line 62
17:45 <ryanofsky> line 79 is the equivalent place, but in the parent process, not the child process
17:46 <troygiorshev> ryanofsky: ah thanks
17:47 <troygiorshev> i think these questions link nicely into your question 4
17:47 <michaelfolkson> line 79 is the equivalent place, but in the parent process? Why is the parent exiting?
17:48 <nehan> where is m_loop initialized?
17:48 <ryanofsky> michaelfolkson, oh I just meant it is the equivalent place in terms of blocking, lines 62 and 79 both block the thread and wait for and respond to incoming requests
17:49 <michaelfolkson> Oh ok gotcha
17:50 <ryanofsky> nehan, it's initialized in the m_loop.emplace() calls
17:50 <nehan> ryanofsky: ah, ok thanks
17:50 <michaelfolkson> I think troygiorshev wants to answer question 4
17:51 <ryanofsky> as you can see and as troygiorshev question 4 reference gets to, IpcProtocol is kind of a messy glue code class
17:51 <ryanofsky> it has connect() and serve() methods that take file descriptors
17:51 <ryanofsky> in a future PR it also gets a listen() method to be able to accept incoming connections
17:52 <ryanofsky> but question 4 first asks if you wanted to get rid of capnproto, and use a different protocol like gRPC or JSONRPC or something custom, would the method definitions hve to change?
17:53 <ryanofsky> and then if you wanted to use a different type of channel other than pipes/file descriptors, how would it have to change?
17:55 <michaelfolkson> I'm guessing the first part of that question is no
17:55 <troygiorshev> without looking deeply into any IPC protocols, I want to guess no to both questions
17:56 <ryanofsky> michaelfolkson, yes, that's basically design goal to make protocol swappable
17:56 <nehan> i guess if you wanted to use something other than file descriptors you'd have to tell the processes how to talk to each other
17:56 <troygiorshev> i can't picture a useful connectionless IPC protocol (though I'm sure there's something out there)
17:56 <ryanofsky> troygiorshev, could be yes/no in different cases, like this is just passing int file descriptors
17:56 <nehan> like spawn() would have to pass in something else
17:57 <ryanofsky> but on windows file descriptors aren't weird HANDLE types instead of ints, so maybe you'd pass handles
17:57 <ryanofsky> or if you wanted to use openssl, maybe you'd pass objects with read and write methods, or callbacks or something else
17:57 <troygiorshev> right, unless those can be represented by an int
17:58 <troygiorshev> (but that's very antithetical to the whole "everything is an object" approach of windows)
17:58 <ryanofsky> I think it works in practice if your int is big enough, but yeah
17:59 <ryanofsky> THese questions were mostly intended to be prompts to look at the code, so glad we did a little bit of that :)
18:00 <ryanofsky> Can wrap up, and happy to answer try to clarify anything else later
18:00 <troygiorshev> thanks ryanofsky and thanks for the amazing notes!
18:00 <nehan> ryanofsky: why did you choose file descriptors as the interface instead of something more general? what would it take to run processes on different machines?
18:00 <nehan> thanks!
18:01 <lightlike> thanks!
18:01 <ryanofsky> nehan, just for convenience because I never did the windows port yet. When I do I'll probably just make a typedef
18:01 <ryanofsky> Even using file descriptors though, you could pass connections to different machines since TCP sockets give you file descriptors too
18:02 <michaelfolkson> So this process separation marathon is almost over? Just the four remaining PRs to get merged?! https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/projects/10
18:03 <michaelfolkson> It is really hard to catch up on all these years of work in an afternoon haha. I think we covered a previous PR on interfaces at a previous PR review club
18:04 <ryanofsky> michaelfolkson, Basically yes with exception that starting bitcoin-wallet tool and connecting to node isn't greately useful even with those 4 prs
18:04 <michaelfolkson> This in February https://bitcoincore.reviews/17954.html
18:04 <ryanofsky> followup PR would add a "serve" wallet tool subcommand or something similar so the wallet tool could connect to the node and then actually do useful operations
18:05 <ryanofsky> Yeah, there's a lot here. Appreciate you guys taking interest and digging in.
