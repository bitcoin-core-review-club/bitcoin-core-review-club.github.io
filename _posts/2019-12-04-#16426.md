title: "#16426 Reverse cs_main, cs_wallet lock order and reduce cs_main locking"
pr: 16426

## Notes

* The wallet is an integral part of the bitcoind full node for historic
  reasons. See the [first git
  commit](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/4405b78#diff-118fcbaaba162ba17933c7893247df3aR2547)
  where the wallet lock `cs_wallet` is taken after `cs_main`.

* The wallet was split from the node in [PR 10973](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10973).

* The new interface `interfaces::Chain` lets the wallet access chain and
  mempool state for its own operations. Interface methods allow the wallet to 
  do things like access the block height to know a transaction's confirmation
  depth or estimate the feerate.

* Some heavily-used `interfaces::Chain` methods impose synchronicity between
  wallet and node because `Chain::Lock` needs to be taken by the wallet
  before its own lock.

* Switching the lock order from `cs_main` -> `cs_wallet` to `cs_wallet` ->
  `cs_main` would avoid needlessly stalling the node when there is no need to
  access chain data.

* [PR 15931](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15931) removed
  `GetDepthInMainChain`'s requirement to lock the chain and simplified the
  reasoning on locks and events ordering.

* A long-term goal is to separate major components of the Bitcoin Code node (the
  wallet, the P2P layer, the GUI) to let them evolve independently and only
  communicate asynchronically through well-defined interfaces: See
  [ryanofsky's github issue](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10102) or
  [eklitzke's blog post](https://eklitzke.org/multiprocess-bitcoin) for
  reasoning.

* To learn more about lock management in Bitcoin Core:
  * [The Bitcoin Core debug_lockorder notes](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/developer-notes.md#debug_lockorder)
    explain how to compile and run bitcoind with deadlock detection.
  * [The clang Thread Safety Analysis documentation](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ThreadSafetyAnalysis.html)
    gives information about static analysis of locks in the clang compiler.
  * Reading Bitcoin Core's locking code in `src/sync.h` is also recommended.

   NACK?](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#peer-review)
   (Don't forget to put your PR review on GitHub.)

2. Did you take any steps beyond reading the code? Did you run the tests on
   your local machine with `--enable-debug`?

3. While where reading the code, which commit(s) attracted your attention? What
   should be carefully examined? What could go wrong?

4. What could happen if a deadlock was introduced in the code?

5. Did this PR changes the wallet behavior?

6. Why does the lock order need to be inverted all at once?

7. Do you expect this PR to have any impact on performace?

8. Can you think of any other way to remove the `cs_main` lock from the wallet
   code?

9. What further changes could be build on top of this PR?
