## Notes

This week, we'll continue our review of the [Python implementation of
Minisketch](https://github.com/sipa/minisketch/pull/26).

See the notes from [our previous review club on Minisketch](./minisketch-26).

## Questions

1. (previously [question 6](./minisketch-26#questions)) To actually find the roots, the
   Berlekamp Trace Algorithm is used. It uses the
   [trace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_trace) function `t(x) = x + x^2 +
   x^4 + ... + x^(fieldsize/2)` which maps every element of a field of size `2^n`
   to `0` or `1`. In our 8-bit field that means `t(x) = x + x^2 + x^4 + x^8 +
   x^16 + x^32 + x^64 + x^128`.  This means that for any non-zero field element `p`,
   `tr(p*x)` also has this property, and every choice of `p` will map a different
   subset of field elements to 0 (and the others to 1). How is this property used
   to recursively split the polynomial into smaller and smaller ones?
