## Notes

- Bitcoin Core requires several
  [dependencies](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/dependencies.md).
  These include large dependencies such as [boost](https://www.boost.org/),
  [libevent](https://libevent.org/) and [qt](https://www.qt.io), as well as
  several smaller dependencies.

- These dependencies can be built locally as part of a [depends
  build](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/depends/README.md).

- The versions of each dependency library is pinned by a specific hash
  (e.g.
  [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/652c45fdbbd55bde95c8c6cf08a5feb6055ac112/depends/packages/bdb.mk#L5)
  for bdb).

- Sometimes small changes need to be made to the library before building. This
  has previously been done using [sed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sed).

- `sed` (**s**tream **ed**itor) is a lightweight tool that is often used for
  text substitutions.

- This PR changes some of those `sed` commands for
  [patch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patch_(Unix)) files, which more
  explicitly document the exact substitution.

## Questions

1. Why might we want to replace the usage of `sed` in our dependency builder
   with patches?

2. What makes patches any better than sed? Are there any potential downsides?

3. After this PR, there are 9 usages of sed left. Why can't we replace all of
   them?

4. How would you test this PR?

5. How could we verify that the patches are being applied correctly?
