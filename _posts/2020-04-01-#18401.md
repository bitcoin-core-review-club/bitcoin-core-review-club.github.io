This week, we'll review two (small) PRs:

- [PR 18401: Initialize PrecomputedTransactionData in
  CheckInputScripts](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18401)
- [PR 18422: Move single-sig checking EvalScript code to
  EvalChecksig](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18422).

## Notes

- A few weeks ago, [we looked at PRs 16902 and
  18002](https://bitcoincore.reviews/16902.html), which had both been pulled
  out of [PR 17977, the WIP schnorr/taproot
  implementation](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17977). This week,
  we'll look at two more small refactor PRs that have also been pulled out of
  that PR.

- The same general considerations apply to these PRs: ordinarily, these
  refactor changes to consensus code wouldn't meet the bar for review cost and
  risk -vs- benefit.  However, splitting them off from the main schnorr/taproot
  PR makes reviewing the logical changes to consensus in the main PR easier and
  safer.

### PR 18401: Initialize PrecomputedTransactionData in CheckInputScripts

- When a signature for a transaction input is created or verified, different
  parts of the transaction are hashed into a _transaction digest_. This is the
  `e` value in `e = Hash(m)` that is used in the [signing/verification
  algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_Curve_Digital_Signature_Algorithm#Signature_generation_algorithm).
  The transaction digest algorithm for pre-segwit transaction inputs is
  documented [here](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/OP_CHECKSIG#How_it_works) (in
  particular, look at the `verifyThisStr` string in step 9 of the
  [diagram](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/File:Bitcoin_OpCheckSig_InDetail.png),
  which is the data that is hashed).

- For pre-segwit transaction inputs, the transaction digest has to be
  recalculated from scratch for each signature. This means that in the worst
  case the amount of data that needs to be hashed is quadratic in the size of
  the transaction. See [Sergio Demian Lerner's bitcoin talk
  post](https://bitcointalk.org/?topic=140078) for more details of this
  _quadratic hashing_ issue. The [Bitcoin Core
  blog](https://bitcoincore.org/en/2016/01/26/segwit-benefits/#linear-scaling-of-sighash-operations)
  and [Rusty Russell's blog](http://rusty.ozlabs.org/?p=522) also have good
  explanations.

- To resolve the quadratic hashing problem, the way that the transaction digest
  is calculated was changed for segwit inputs. See [BIP
  143](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0143.mediawiki) for the
  motivation and specification.

- The segwit transaction digest is designed so that parts of the digest are
  shared between all the signatures in a transaction. This means that the total
  amount of data to be hashed for the transaction is linear in the size of the
  transaction.

- This shared data between all signatures of a transaction is stored in the
  `PrecomputedTransactionData` object, which was added in [PR
  8524](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8524).

- Segwit v1 (taproot) makes some very minor changes to the transaction
  digest algorithm. Specifically, the transaction digest commits to the
  amounts of all inputs (instead of just the amount of the input being signed)
  and to the scriptPubKey of the output being spent. See [BIP
  341](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0341.mediawiki#common-signature-message)
  for the full description of the transaction digest.

- Because of these changes, more data needs to be stored in the
  `PrecomputedTransactionData` object. This PR changes the way that the object
  is constructed and initialized so that a [future commit in PR
  17977](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17977/commits/dd0622b8e2f8a324fdf73eb476f136ee556f3e68)
  can add that data to the object.

### PR 18422: Move single-sig checking EvalScript code to EvalChecksig

- [Tapscript](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0342.mediawiki)
  is the scripting language used for scripts in a taproot tree (taproot has
  versioning for scripts, so a future soft fork could introduce a different
  scripting version or language).

- Tapscript has almost the same semantics as Bitcoin Script. One notable
  difference is that `OP_CHECKSIG` and `OP_CHECKSIGVERIFY` both verify schnorr
  signatures instead of ECDSA signatures.

- This PR extracts most of the logic for `OP_CHECKSIG` and
  `OP_CHECKSIGVERIFY` from the very large `EvalScript()` function.

- A [future commit in PR
  17977](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17977/commits/af411a6cbec12375627aff374874a7f24b7c07e9)
  modifies this function to switch on which flags have been passed into the
  script interpreter in order to determine whether to do schnorr or ECDSA
  signature verification.

## Questions

1. Did you review the PRs? [Concept ACK, approach ACK, tested ACK, or
   NACK?](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#peer-review)
   (Don't forget to put your PR review on GitHub.)

2. A new `PrecomputedTransactionData` default constructor is added which
   doesn't initialize the data members. Where do they get initialized instead?

3. What new data members are added to `PrecomputedTransationData` in the
   subsequent commit in the taproot PR 17977?

4. Is the old `PrecomputedTransactionData` constructor still used anywhere?

5. Why is the transaction digest algorithm changed for taproot? What problems
   does the new algorithm solve?

6. What is the difference between `EvalCheckSig()` returning `false` and setting
   the return parameter `fSuccess` to `false`? When would those different
   failure modes be used?

7. Why isn't the code for `OP_CHECKMULTISIG` and `OP_CHECKMULTISIGVERIFY` also
   extracted out in PR 18401?
