## Notes

- There are a variety of different P2P connection types that Bitcoin Core nodes
  can have to peers. See the `ConnectionType` enum in net.h for the different
  types.

- Our test framework has previously only allowed two types of connection:
  - _manual_ connections to make a connection from one bitcoind instance to
    another bitcoind instance. See `BitcoinTestFramework.connect_nodes()`,
    which calls bitcoindâ€™s `addnode` RPC method.
  - _inbound_ connection made from the Python test framework to the bitcoind
    instance. See the `TestNode.add_p2p_connection()` method.

- This PR adds the ability to create _full outbound_ and _block-relay-only_
  connections from the bitcoind instances to the Python test framework.

- This PR adds functionality in the bitcoind C++ code and in the test framework
  Python code:
  - In bitcoind, a test-only `addconnection` method is added, which allows
    different types of connections to be made.
  - In the Python test framework, `TestNode.add_outbound_p2p_connection()` is added,
    along with `P2PInterface.peer_accept_connection()`, which allows the test framework
    to accept incoming connections.

  We'll focus mainly on the C++ code in this review club.

## Questions

1. What are Bitcoin Core's different connection types?

2. In the test framework, what is the difference between connecting two
   bitcoind nodes and using a P2P connection? 

3. Why would it be useful to create outbound or block-relay-only connections in
   the test framework?

4. How does this PR enable creating outbound and block-relay-only connections
   in the test framework?

5. Why do we make some RPC methods hidden, or 'test only'?

6. For each different type of connection, what is the maximum number of
   connections that Bitcoin Core will have by default?

7. What are `CSemaphore` and `CSemaphoreGrant` used for in `CConnman`?
