## Notes

- Today's review club is A Tale of Two Fee Rate Units, and the ability starting
  from Bitcoin Core 0.21 to set one of them explicitly in Bitcoin Core's various
  send RPCs.

- Bitcoin Core has historically used fee rates denominated in bitcoins per 1000
  bytes (BTC/kB); post-segwit, the unit is 1000 virtual bytes (BTC/kvB).

- You can see this by running `./src/bitcoin-cli help settxfee` and
  `./src/bitcoind -help-debug | grep fee`

- For information about units in Bitcoin, don't hesitate to refer to this
  [Bitcoin Optech
  guide](https://github.com/bitcoinops/bitcoinops.github.io/blob/master/STYLE.md#units).

- Nevertheless, users have expressed what appears to be a long-standing
  preference for fee rates to be expressed in satoshis per vbyte (sat/vB)
  instead, which is a commonly used unit in other wallets. This demand can be
  seen, for instance, in Bitcoin Core
  [issues](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui/issues/64) and in [twitter
  polls](https://twitter.com/jonatack/status/1318890833131823104).

#### Background

- [PR 11413](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11413), "Add explicit
  feerate option," was merged in June 2020 after being open since September 2017,
  the second-longest open PR in Bitcoin Core history. That pull enabled users to
  specify for the first time a specific fee rate in some send RPCs. However, it
  did so by overloading the integer `conf_target` param/option to also accept
  floats or strings. Then, if a float or string was passed to represent a fee
  rate instead, the unit was taken from the `estimate_mode` param/option that
  the PR also overloaded. See [this
  comment](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11413#issuecomment-649730975)
  for more context.

- [Issue 19543](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/19543), "Normalize fee
  units for RPC (BTC/kB and sat/B)," was opened in July 2020 to address the
  problem.

- [PR 20220](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/20220), "Explicit fee rate
  follow-ups/fixes for 0.21," was merged in November 2020 to provide a spec and
  regression coverage for the potential next step of moving to a universal fee
  rate argument in satoshis per vbyte (sat/vB) as well as immediate coverage and
  fixes for 0.21.

- The difficulty in making progress on a universal fee rate argument in sat/vB
  resided in discussing with and convincing contributors to get on-board with
  both the goal and the solution in order to achieve a [rough
  consensus](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7282). These discussions took place
  in the Bitcoin Core wallet meetings on IRC, in GitHub comments, and in
  one-on-one IRC conversations with Bitcoin Core contributors and
  maintainers. This can be a long process, but in this case, after some initial
  resistance, consensus began to form quickly.

- [PR 20305](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/20305), "Introduce
  `fee_rate` sat/vB param/option," was merged in November 2020 to address issue
  19543 and is part of the 0.21 release. It replaces overloading the
  `conf_target` and `estimate_mode` params/options with a new `fee_rate`
  param/option denominated in sat/vB in the sendtoaddress, sendmany, send,
  fundrawtransaction, walletcreatefundedpsbt, and bumpfee RPCs, as well as other
  fixes. It was followed by [PR
  20246](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/20426), "Allow zero-fee
  fundrawtransaction/walletcreatefundedpsbt and other fixes," that was
  backported to 0.21.

#### Current situation

- RPCs `sendtoaddress`, `sendmany`, `send`, `fundrawtransaction`,
  `walletcreatefundedpsbt`, and `bumpfee` all allow specifying an explicit fee
  rate in sat/vB starting from Bitcoin Core v0.21 released in January 2021.

- It would be
  [ideal](http://www.erisian.com.au/bitcoin-core-dev/log-2021-01-15.html#l-769)
  for all fee rates to be in the same units. However, if you run `git grep
  feeRate`, you will see that we still have a similarly spelled `feeRate`
  (BTC/kvB) option in RPCs `fundrawtransaction` and `walletcreatefundedpsbt`
  that could confuse users, as `fee_rate` and `feeRate` have different units and
  similar spellings.

- [PR 20483](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/20483), "deprecate feeRate
  in fundrawtransaction/walletcreatefundedpsbt," was opened to deprecate the
  `feeRate` option but cannot yet be considered. (Why?)

- All of the fee rate configuration options are currently still denominated in
  BTC/kvB units and need to be updated.

- [Issue 20534](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/20534), "sat/b values
  aren't validated to be in range," was opened in November 2020 and remains
  unresolved.

#### Code

- Today's PR is an accessible change to resolve issue 20534 while doing some
  `CFeeRate` refactoring (see the pull request description for details). After
  an initial simpler approach that was judged insufficient, the proposal was
  overhauled to be much better and is awaiting feedback.

- The `CFeeRate` class in `src/policy/feerate.{h,cpp}` is responsible for
  constructing fee rates of different units. It also contains comparison
  operators and a `ToString()` helper function.

- `SetFeeEstimateMode()` in `src/wallet/rpcwallet.cpp` is the central function
  for setting fee estimation or the fee rate that is used by the wallet
  transaction RPCs and by `FundTransaction()` that some of the RPCs call
  through. These are all located in the same file, `rpcwallet.cpp`.

- `AmountFromValue()` in `src/rpc/util.cpp` is a frequently used utility that
  converts `UniValue` amounts from user input to `CAmount` values suitable for
  constructing `CFeeRate` objects.

## Questions

1.  Explain the difference between BTC/kvB and sat/vB units. A fee rate of 1
    BTC/kvB is equivalent to what fee rate in sat/vB?

2.  What is the difference between an RPC *parameter* and an RPC *option*?

3.  When making transactions, what fee practice does the ability to specify an
    explicit fee rate replace?

4.  At the time of this writing, why is it too early to deprecate the `feeRate`
    (BTC/kvB) option in `fundrawtransaction` and `walletcreatefundedpsbt` to
    avoid confusion with `fee_rate` (sat/vB)?

5.  After some discussion, a plan was made to complete the migration from
    BTC/kvB to sat/vB units. What is it? Does it make sense to you?

6.  In the meantime, if users confuse `fee_rate` with `feeRate` when making a
    transaction or fee bumping, why was the risk of losing funds considered low
    enough to be temporarily acceptable?

7.  What range of values is non-representable by `CFeeRate`? How does this PR
    resolve that? Is there a better approach?

8.  What is the "Named Constructor Idiom"? Why does this PR use it?

9.  The new utility function, `FeeRateFromValueInSatB()`, calls another utility
    function named `AmountFromValue()`. Why are there two of them in the
    codebase (one in `src/rpc/util.cpp` and one in `src/bitcoin-tx.cpp`)?

10. Running `./src/bitcoind -help-debug | grep fee` returns the fee rate
    configuration options. After `setfeerate` and `estimatefeerate` in sat/vB
    are added and `settxfee` and `estimatesmartfee` in BTC/kvB become hidden
    RPCs, what would be the best way to migrate the fee rate units in these
    configuration options from BTC/kvB to sat/vB?
