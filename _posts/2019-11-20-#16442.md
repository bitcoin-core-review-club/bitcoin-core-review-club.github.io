## Notes

- Recall from the review club meeting for [PR #15845](https://bitcoincore.reviews/15845.html)
that we discussed [BIP 158](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0158.mediawiki)
which defines _compact block filters_.

- [BIP 157](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0157.mediawiki) is the
proposed specification for requesting and sending compact filters between nodes
on the p2p network.

- This PR is an implementation of BIP157, such that full nodes with filter indexing
enabled can serve those filters to peers that ask _nicely_ :-)

## Questions

1. Did you review the PR? [Concept ACK, approach ACK, tested ACK, or
NACK?](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#peer-review)
(Don't forget to put your PR review on GitHub.)

2. How does a node signal to the network that it can serve compact block filters?

3. What is the behavior of a node that has not finished generating and indexing
compact filters for every block in the chain?

4. Does this PR expose any new denial-of-service attack vectors? If so, how are
they being handled? Could this be improved?

5. What is the purpose of the `cfcheckpt` message?

6. Can Bitcoin Core be used to _retrieve_ compact block filters from another peer?

7. How is the test coverage in this PR? Do you think it could be improved, and how?
Are there other ways to test this PR outside of the usual testing framework?
