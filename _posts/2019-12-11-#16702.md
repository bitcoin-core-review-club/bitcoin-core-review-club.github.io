    "TL;DR. We present the Erebus attack, which allows large malicious Internet
Service Providers (ISPs) to isolate any targeted public Bitcoin nodes from the
Bitcoin peer-to-peer network. The Erebus attack does not require routing
manipulation (e.g., BGP hijacks) and hence it is virtually undetectable to any
control-plane and even typical data-plane detectors."
