## Notes

### Motivation

- Bitcoin Core issue #16599 ["ASN-based bucketing of the network
nodes"](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/16599) (13 August 2019)

- Bitcoin Core IRC meeting discussion ["#topic ASN blobs
(BlueMatt)"](http://www.erisian.com.au/bitcoin-core-dev/log-2019-06-20.html#l-518)
(20 June 2019)

### Definitions

- An [autonomous system
(AS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_system_%28Internet%29) is a
collection of connected Internet Protocol (IP) routing prefixes under the
control of one or more network operators (typically ISPs or large companies) on
behalf of a single administrative entity or domain that presents a common,
clearly defined routing policy to the internet.

- An **autonomous system number (ASN)** is a globally unique identifier allocated
to each AS for use in BGP routing. The ASN uniquely identifies each network on
the Internet.

- [Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BGP) addresses
the routing of packets among different autonomous systems to connect them. BGP
uses ASNs to uniquely identify each AS.

- [BGP hijacking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BGP_hijacking) (sometimes
referred to as "prefix hijacking", "route hijacking" or "IP hijacking") is the
illegitimate takeover of groups of IP addresses by the act of corrupting
Internet routing tables maintained using the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP).

### Notes

- By default, Bitcoin Core 0.19 allows [up to 125
connections](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/0.19/src/net.h#L79) to
different peers, 10 of which are outbound: [8
full-relay](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/0.19/src/net.h#L65) and [2
block-relay only](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15759).

- These outbound connections rely on bucketing by network groups (/16 prefix)
for network diversification.

- Due to the non-uniformity of IP distribution among ASNs, bucketing 8 outbound
connections by /16 prefix network groups may result in connecting to 8 peers
from just 2 large ASNs.

- The idea is that allowing nodes to connect to each ASN *only once* should
increase the security of the Bitcoin network by diversifying connections.

- Diversifying network connections is motivated by the [Erebus
  Attack](/16702.html#erebus-attack). The word *Erebus* is ancient Greek for
  “shadow” or “darkness” and underscores the attack's stealthy nature.
  Resources for related network attacks ([Eclipse
  attack](/16702.html#eclipse-attack), [BGP
  hijacking](/16702.html#bgp-hijacking)) are included below.

- Instead of relying on the /16 IP prefix to diversify the connections every
node creates, this PR proposes to rely instead on IP-to-ASN mapping, if the
mapping is provided.

- A .map file would be created by every user independently based on a router
dump or provided along with the Bitcoin release. The PR currently uses Python
scripts written by sipa to create a .map file under 2MB.

#### Erebus attack

  - Website ["A Stealthier Partitioning Attack against Bitcoin Peer-to-Peer
Network"](https://erebus-attack.comp.nus.edu.sg/) (last updated 15 August 2019)

    "TL;DR. We present the Erebus attack, which allows large malicious Internet
Service Providers (ISPs) to isolate any targeted public Bitcoin nodes from the
Bitcoin peer-to-peer network. The Erebus attack does not require routing
manipulation (e.g., BGP hijacks) and hence it is virtually undetectable to any
control-plane and even typical data-plane detectors."

## Questions

1. Did you review the PR? [Concept ACK, approach ACK, ACK \<commit\>, or
  NACK?](https://github.com/jonatack/bitcoin-development/blob/master/how-to-review-bitcoin-core-prs.md#peer-review)&nbsp;
  Don't forget to put your PR review on GitHub or [ask
  questions](https://github.com/jonatack/bitcoin-development/blob/master/how-to-review-bitcoin-core-prs.md#ask-questions).

2. What steps did you take to review this PR? Did you try the [asmap effect
  analysis
  script](https://github.com/naumenkogs/bitcoin_network_analysis/blob/master/asmap/test.py),
  custom prints/logging, or modifying the code/tests?

3. Did you read the Erebus website and paper? Did you study the Eclipse attack
   and the BGP hijacking attack?

4. Briefly describe:
  - the Erebus attack: can it be detected; is it scaleable against multiple
   Bitcoin nodes?
  - the BGP hijacking attack (Apostolaski et al.)
  - the Eclipse attack (Heilman et al.)
  - major differences between the three

5. What are potential countermeasures to defend against the Erebus attack and
   their current implementation status?

6. This PR claims to increase Bitcoin's network security by using ASN
   information for addrman bucketing and for diversifying peer connections. Do
   you agree? Do you see any tradeoffs?

7. What do you think about the vectors to circumvent the asmap protection
   mentioned by [wiz](https://github.com/wiz) in this [review
   comment](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16702#issuecomment-524542883)
   and the replies by [practicalswift](https://github.com/practicalswift) and
   [TheBlueMatt](https://github.com/TheBlueMatt)?

8. What do you think of the implementation? How should the .map file be
   distributed -- in the binary or outside it? Should the data be hosted in the
   Bitcoin Core repository?

9. Any thoughts on the test coverage?  Do you see anything that is not tested or
   could also be tested?
