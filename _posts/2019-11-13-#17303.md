## Notes

- [Transactions in Bitcoin are gossiped](https://btcinformation.org/en/developer-guide#transaction-broadcasting) by
  `inv` messages (a list of tx hashes) after they have been validated by the node. Peers can respond to these `inv`
  messages with a `getdata` message to request the transaction.
- Bitcoin Core keeps a "relay memory" of all transactions that were sent out as `inv`s for 15 minutes. `getdata`
  requests are answered from this relay memory.
- [A recent change (#16851)](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16851) in the `master` branch of Bitcoin Core
  enables relay of transactions that have been removed from the relay memory. The motivation for this change was that
  low fee transactions that either didn't make the inital relay or were evicted later on can now be requested. This
  allows for example to bump a low fee transaction higher in the mempool with a CPFP transaction.
  Also, it makes it possible for nodes to catch up on parent transaction when the node has been started with an empty
  mempool.
- Transactions that made it into the relay memory stay there for 15 minutes, even if they have been included in a block
  or have been replaced by a higher fee transaction in the mempool. [The proposed change
  (#17303))](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17303) removes the relay memory and uses the mempool exclusively as
  the relay memory. The change claims to improve privacy.

## Questions

1. Did you review the PR? [Concept ACK, approach ACK, tested ACK, or
  NACK?](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#peer-review)
  (Don't forget to put your PR review on GitHub.)

2. What steps did you take, beyond reading the code?

3. What is a shared pointer and why are transactions in Bitcoin Core generally managed as a shared pointer
   (`CTransactionRef`)?

4. Is there an upper bound on the memory usage of the relay memory (`mapRelay`)? Under what circumstances is the expected
   memory usage low, under what circumstances is the memory usage high? (Hint: `CTransactionRef` is a shared pointer)

5. Transactions are added to `mapRelay` when they are announced via an `inv`. Does `mapRelay` keep track of which peers
   it announced a transaction to? If no, how does that affect transaction relay privacy?

6. Do you think this change can be tested efficiently with unit or functional tests and why?
