## Notes

- An _address index_ is an index from addresses or scriptPubKeys to the
  transactions in the block chain that create outputs to that address or spend
  outputs from that address.

- Adding an address index is a very common feature request for Bitcoin Core.
  Being able to lookup transactions from an address is useful for block
  explorers or other services that need to scan the block chain. Example
  requests:
  [1](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2802#issuecomment-26712372),
  [2](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14053#issuecomment-558344637)

- There have been several patches and additional software to produce
  transaction indexes over the years:
  [Bitcore](https://github.com/bitpay/bitcore),
  [electrs](https://github.com/romanz/electrs) and
  [ElectrumX](https://github.com/kyuupichan/electrumx/) are three examples.

- There are also centralized block explorer services that provide an
  address-to-transactions lookup. These offer convenience at the cost
  of privacy.

- There have been several attempts to add an address index to Bitcoin Core:
  - [PR 2802: Add an address-based transaction index by sipa](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2802)
  - [PR 3652: Adds transaction index by address by jmcorgan](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3652)
  - [PR 6835: Add address-based index by rnicoll](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6835)

- Address indexes are inherently unscalable since they grow linearly with the
  size of the block chain. Some contributors worry that offering an address
  index in Bitcoin Core may encourage businesses to build Bitcoin services on
  infrastructure that can't scale as the size of the block chain increases.
  Pieter Wuille expresses this concern in the post from his PR: "I hate making it
  easy to build infrastructure that relies on a fully-indexed blockchain (which
  shouldn't be necessary), as it may remove the incentive to build more scalable
  solutions. On the other hand, in cases where the alternative is relying on a
  trusted third party, this approach is certainly preferable, and would allow an
  RPC-based blockexplorer, for example."

- For more discussion on the merits of adding an address index to Bitcoin Core,
  see the discussion in the [13 Dec 2018 Bitcoin Core IRC
  meeting](http://www.erisian.com.au/meetbot/bitcoin-core-dev/2018/bitcoin-core-dev.2018-12-13-19.00.log.html#l-271).

- This latest attempt to add an address index builds on the new auxiliary
  indexes base class introduced in [PR
  13243](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13243). The auxiliary index
  infrastructure runs asynchronously and uses the CValidationInterface to
  receive new block data. That means adding new indexes should have minimal
  impact on performance and low risk of introducing a bug that impacts mainline
  functionality.

- The address index code and tests (`index/addrindex.cpp`, `index/addrindex.h`,
  `test/addrindex_tests.cpp`) added in this PR are similar to the transaction
  index code and tests (`index/txindex.cpp`, `index/txindex.h`,
  `test/txindex_tests.cpp`). Comparing them by eye or using a diff tool may be
  helpful to understand what the new code is doing.

## Questions

1. Do you think Bitcoin Core should include an address index? What are the
   arguments for and against?

2. Did you review the PR? [Concept ACK, approach ACK, ACK \<commit\>, or
  NACK?](https://github.com/jonatack/bitcoin-development/blob/master/how-to-review-bitcoin-core-prs.md#peer-review)&nbsp;
  Don't forget to put your PR review on GitHub or [ask
  questions](https://github.com/jonatack/bitcoin-development/blob/master/how-to-review-bitcoin-core-prs.md#ask-questions).

3. What steps did you take to review and test this PR? Did you try to create an
   address index over the full mainnet block chain?

4. Did you review the unit and functional tests? Are there any additional test
   cases that you'd like to see added?

5. The address index is stored in
  [LevelDB](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/leveldb), which is a key-value
  store. What is used as the key, and what is used as the value?

6. Where is MurmurHash3 used in this PR? How are hash collisions resolved?
   Where else is MurmurHash3 used in the Bitcoin Core codebase?

7. How does the address index handle reorgs?
