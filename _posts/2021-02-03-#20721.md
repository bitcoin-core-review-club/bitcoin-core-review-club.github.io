## Background

- We can think of the Bitcoin Core node as a stack with three levels:

  - **Net** - keeps track of potential nodes to peer with, handles active
    connections to nodes, and reads and writes messages to the wire. The main
    class in the net layer is `CConnman`, which is defined in
    [net.cpp](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/16b784d9/src/net.h). Net
    hands messages up the stack to ...

  - **Net Processing** - reads and processes application-level messages, and
    handles application-level view of peers. The main class in net
    processing is `PeerManager`, which is declared in
    [net_processing.h](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/16b784d9/src/net_processing.h).
    Net processing uses function calls like `ProcessNewBlock()` and
    `AcceptToMemoryPool()` to call into ...

  - **Validation** - is responsible for our view of the block chain and the UTXO
    set. It may (or may not) include a mempool for unconfirmed transactions. There
    are various classes and functions exposed to the rest of the node. [PR
    20158](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/20158) and linked PRs are an
    attempt to clarify and rationalize the interface to validation.

- In early versions of Bitcoin, this distinction wasn't as clear. The [first
  commit](https://github.com/jnewbery/bitcoin/blob/4405b78d/main.cpp) in the
  Bitcoin Core repository has a separate net.cpp file, but net processing and
  validation are mixed in the main.cpp file. It was only in [PR
  9260](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9260) in 2016 that net processing
  and validation were split into separate files.

- Even today, the division between net, net processing and validation is not as
  clear as we'd like. Clarifying and rationalizing these interfaces is an
  ongoing project. See, for example, [PR
  15141](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15141), which moves the denial
  of service logic from validation into net processing, [PR
  20158](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/20158), which rationalizes the
  interface to validation, and [issue
  19398](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/19398), which moves
  application-layer data and logic from net into net processing.

- The high level goal of PR 19398 is to split responsibilities cleanly between
  CConnman and PeerManager:

  - C**Conn**man should be responsible for **connections** - accepting incoming
    and opening outbound connections, opening and closing sockets, reading and
    writing data on those sockets, and first-line-of-defence validation of
    corrupt/malformed messages.

  - **Peer**Manager should be responsible for **peers** - parsing and acting on
    p2p messages from peers, storing state relating to those peers, and
    deciding when to send messages to those peers.

- Today's PR, [PR 20721](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/20721), is
  part of the larger project tracked by issue 19398. It moves the `ping` data
  from net into net processing.

## Notes

- The `ping`/`pong` message exchange acts as a keepalive between peers on the
  peer-to-peer network, and also measures round-trip latency. Lowest ping time
  and most recent ping time are presented to users in the GUI and RPC interface
  and lowest ping time is also used by the net layer in its peer eviction logic.

- Some of the data members, `nPingNonceSent`, `m_ping_start` and `fPingQueued` are
  only ever used by net processing, so they are obvious candidates for moving into the
  `Peer` structure.

- `nMinPingUsecTime` is updated by net processing, but is used by net in its
  inbound node eviction logic.

## Questions

- What's the difference between _system time_ and _mockable time_? When is
  it appropriate to use one or the other?

- In [CConnman::InactivityCheck()](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/16b784d9/src/net.cpp#L1221),
  why do we have a ping timeout? Why not just rely on the send buffer timeout and
  receive buffer timeout?

- Why do certain tests need to be updated in the second commit _Use
  -pingtimeout in tests that might have pings time out_? Why could pings start
  timing out when the ping timeout logic is moved into net processing?

- The first commit, _Add -pingtimeout to configure ping timeout_, adds a new
  configuration option. Is this desirable? When should we add new
  configuration options, and when should we avoid adding new options?

- If the goal of the PR is to move ping data into net processing, why is there
  still a `PingReceived` function in `CNode` (in net) after this PR?
