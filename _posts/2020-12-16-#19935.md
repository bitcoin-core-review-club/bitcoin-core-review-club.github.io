## Notes

This refactor PR moves existing code into new `src/util/hasher.{cpp|h}` files.

Along the way, it touches some interesting code in:

- `src/coins.{cpp|h}`
- `src/index/blockfilter.h`
- `src/script/sigcache.h`
- `src/txmempool.{cpp|h}`
- `src/validation.h`

Hashers are generally used to construct hash maps, which is a data structure
that has fast item lookup, addition and removal. They allow lookup of elements
in `0(1)` time in the typical/best-case scenario although implementation can
affect this.

The C++ standard library includes a hash map
([std::unordered_map](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/unordered_map)).
For a more detailed description of the hash functions used in
`std::unordered_map`, see [Hash functions for C++ Unordered
Containers](https://marknelson.us/posts/2011/09/03/hash-functions-for-c-unordered-containers.html).

### BlockHasher

`BlockHasher` is used by `src/validation.h::BlockMap` to construct a hash map
of blocks and their sequence ID (block height).

`BlockManager` uses the `BlockMap` when adding a new block to the index with
`AddBlockToIndex()`, first checking whether it’s a duplicate
(`src/validation.cpp#L3106`) and then adding the new block and sequence ID to
the index.

### SignatureCacheHasher

`SignatureCacheHasher` is used to avoid performing costly verification of ECDSA
signatures twice; once when accepted into the mempool and again when accepted
into a block.

The cache type currently used for `CSignatureCache` is “cuckoo cache”,
implemented in [PR 8895](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8895).

### FilterHeaderHasher

`FilterHeaderHasher` is used by
`src/index/blockfilterindex.h::BlockFilterIndex` to construct an index of
([BIP157](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0157.mediawiki))
filter headers for each filter type enabled.

However, `BlockFilterIndex` only consults the `m_headers_cache` lookup if the
block index is at a “checkpoint” height -- every 1000 blocks per BIP157.

### SaltedOutpointHasher

The `Coin` object requires `CCoinsMap` to use `SaltedOutpointHasher` in its map
of `CCoinsCacheEntry`(s).

`CCoinsMap` is used by `CCoinsViewCache` with most of its methods. As discussed
in the [review club meeting for PR 18113](18113) each
`CCoinsCacheEntry` contains both the `Coin` itself in addition to the flags
associated with that coin.

### SaltedTxidHasher

This is currently used in the [mempool's
multi-index](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/6a480636/src/txmempool.h#L519-L527).

### SaltedSipHasher

`SaltedSipHasher` is a generic
[siphasher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SipHash) that can be used with many
objects (via the magic of `Span` [#18468](https://bitcoincore.reviews/18468))

## Questions

1. Did you review the PR? [Concept ACK, approach ACK, tested ACK, or
   NACK](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#peer-review)?

2. Why do we need to specify a "hasher" when defining a `std::unordered_map`?

3. What exactly is a `Coin` as used by `CCoinsMap` and hashed using
   `SaltedOutpointHasher`?

4. Why does `src/coins.cpp` use a `SaltedOutpointHasher` rather than a
   `SaltedTxidHasher`?

5. What is a "salt" and why are they used in `SaltedTxidHasher`,
   `SaltedOutpointHasher` and `SaltedSipHasher`?

6. Why are salts _not_ used in `BlockHasher`, `SignatureCacheHasher` and
   `FilterHeaderHasher`?

7. What is a boost multi-index? How is the `SaltedTxidHasher` used in the
   mempool multi-index?

8. What is the advantage of introducing a new `SaltedSipHasher` that takes a
   `Span` as input? Where would we _not_ be able to use this?
