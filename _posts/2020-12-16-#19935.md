## Notes

The PR is mostly moving existing code into two new files:
```
src/util/hasher.{cpp|h}
```

But touches some interesting code in:
```
src/coins.{cpp|h}
src/index/blockfilter.h
src/script/sigcache.h
src/txmempool.{cpp|h}
src/validation.h
```

Hashers are generally used to construct hashmaps of groups of items for fast item lookup, addition and removal.

They allow lookup of elements in `0(1)` lookup time in the typical/best-case scenario although implementation can affect this. You can see the implementation of `std::unordered_map` here: [cppreference/unordered_map](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/unordered_map). For even more detail, take a look at this blog post: [Hash functions for C++ Unordered Containers](https://marknelson.us/posts/2011/09/03/hash-functions-for-c-unordered-containers.html).

### BlockHasher

`BlockHasher` is used by `src/validation.h::BlockMap` to construct a hashmap of blocks and their sequence ID (block height).

This `BlockMap` is used by `BlockManager` and in turn by `ChainstateManager` which is managing the currently active chain.

`BlockManager` uses the `BlockMap` when adding a new block to the index with `AddBlockToIndex`, first checking whether it’s a duplicate (`src/validation.cpp#L3106`) and then adding the new block and sequence ID to the index.

### SignatureCacheHasher

`SignatureCacheHasher` is used to avoid performing costly verification of ECDSA signatures twice; once when accepted into mempool and again when accepted into a block.

The cache type currently used for `CSignatureCache is “cuckoo cache”, implemented in [#8895](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8895).

### FilterHeaderHasher

`FilterHeaderHasher` is used by `src/index/blockfilterindex.h::BlockFilterIndex` to construct an index of ([BIP157](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0157.mediawiki)) filter headers for each filter type enabled.

However `BlockFilterIndex` only consults the `m_headers_cache` lookup if the block index is at a “checkpoint” height -- every 1000 blocks per BIP157.

### SaltedOutpointHasher

The `Coin` object requires `CCoinsMap` to use `SaltedOutpointHasher` in its map of `CCoinsCacheEntry`(s).

`CCoinsMap` is used by `CCoinsViewCache` with most of its methods. As discussed in review-club [18113](https://bitcoincore.reviews/18113) each `CCoinsCacheEntry` contains both the `Coin` itself in addition to the flags associated with that coin.

### SaltedTxidHasher

This is currently used in the [cTxMempool multi-index](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/6a48063671770e77266f8e441cc15487d1fff5ed/src/txmempool.h#L519-L527) when sorting the mempool by txid or wtxid.

### SaltedSipHasher

A generic [siphasher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SipHash) that can be used with many objects (via the magic of `Span` [#18468](https://bitcoincore.reviews/18468))

## Questions

1. Did you review the PR? [Concept ACK, approach ACK, tested ACK, or NACK](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#peer-review)? (You’re always encouraged to put your PR review on GitHub, even after the PR has been merged.)

1. Why can't we use just use a regular `std::unordered_map` to create our hash tables (why do we need all these "hashers")? 

1. What exactly is a `Coin` as used by `CCoinsMap` and hashed using `SaltedOutpointHasher`?

1. Why does `src/coins.cpp` use a `SaltedOutpointHasher` rather than a `SaltedTxidHasher`? Are there any trade offs to this decision?

1. What is a "salt" and why are they used in `SaltedTxidHasher`, `SaltedOutpointHasher` and `SaltedSipHasher`?

1. Why are salts _not_ used in `BlockHasher`, `SignatureCacheHasher` and `FilterHeaderHasher`?

1. What other use cases could you think of for any of the hashers?

1. What is the advantage of Introducing a new `SaltedSipHasher` that takes a `Span` as input? Where would we _not_ be able to use this
