title: "#16688 log: Add validation interface logging (logging)"
---

[https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16688](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16688)

## Notes

- The
  [validation layer](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/0d20c42a014ff95aab1447a92605c3a194cfeecc/src/validation.cpp)
  enforces Bitcoin's consensus rules.
- It processes blocks and transactions from the net processing layer and updates the validated
  chain state (`CChainState`) and mempool (`CTxMemPool`).
- Clients can subscribe to updates from the validation layer using the [`CValidationInterface`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/0d20c42a014ff95aab1447a92605c3a194cfeecc/src/validationinterface.h#L56).
- The validation layer notifies `CValidationInterface` subscribers whenever the mempool or chainstate is updated. Some interface methods are (see *validationinterface.cpp* for the full list of interface methods):
    - [`UpdatedBlockTip`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/0d20c42a014ff95aab1447a92605c3a194cfeecc/src/validationinterface.h#L87) (fired once when the block chain is extended with one or more new blocks)
    - [`BlockConnected`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/0d20c42a014ff95aab1447a92605c3a194cfeecc/src/validationinterface.h#L111) (fired once for every block added to the block chain. The notification includes the serialized block with transactions)
    - [`TransactionAddedToMempool`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/0d20c42a014ff95aab1447a92605c3a194cfeecc/src/validationinterface.h#L93) (fired whenever a new transaction is accepted into the mempool. The notification includes the serialized transaction)

## Questions

- What's the reason for adding logging to event notification?
- What mechanism is used to notify listeners of validation events?
- What code implements `CValidationInterface`? What does it use event
  notifications for?
- What is a `CBlockLocator`? How is it used in this PR? How else is it used?
- What refactorings are included in this PR?
- How can this PR be tested? Could any other tests have been added?
