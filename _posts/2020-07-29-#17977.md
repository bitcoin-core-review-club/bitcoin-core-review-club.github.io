This is the third Review Club meeting on the (work in progress) implementation
of BIP 340-342.  We've previously looked at:

- [O(1) OP_IF/NOTIF/ELSE/ENDIF script implementation / Abstract out script
  execution out of VerifyWitnessProgram()](./16902)
- [Initialize PrecomputedTransactionData in CheckInputScripts and Move
  single-sig checking EvalScript code to EvalChecksig](./18401)

Those preliminary changes have been merged into the master branch in separate PRs.

This week, we'll look at one commit from PR 17977 - _[Implement Taproot
signature
hashing](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/commit/41d08f5d77f52bec0e31bb081d85fff2d67d0467)_.

**Participants are encouraged to review [the notes from the session on
PR18401](./18401) in particular, since we'll be covering a lot of the same
topics this week.**

## Notes

- The _transaction digest_ that is used in signature creation and verification
  is calculated from different parts of the transaction. There are extensive
  notes covering this topic from [our session on
PR18401](https://bitcoincore.reviews/18401#pr-18401-initialize-precomputedtransactiondata-in-checkinputscripts).

- BIP 341 contains [the specification of the new signature validation
  rules](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0341.mediawiki#signature-validation-rules).

- The [Taproot BIP Review series](https://github.com/ajtowns/taproot-review/)
  covered this topic in [week
  4](https://github.com/ajtowns/taproot-review/blob/master/week-4.md#signature-details).
  [The meeting
  log](http://www.erisian.com.au/meetbot/taproot-bip-review/2019/taproot-bip-review.2019-11-26-19.01.log.html)
  from that review session has more details.

- This week, we'll review the implementation of the Taproot transaction hashing
  algorithm. We won't look at full signature validation. It may be useful to
  checkout just up to the commit _Implement Taproot signature hashing (BIP 341)_.
  Specifically, we'll be looking at the `SignatureHashSchnorr()` function in
  `src/script/interpreter.cpp`.

- It's probably most instructive to compare the new `SignatureHashSchnorr()`
  function to the `SignatureHash()` function immediately below, which
  calculates the signature hash for segwit v0 and legacy transactions.

## Questions

1. `SignatureHashSchnorr()` is a templated function. Why?  What types `T` is
   the template function instantiated with? _Hint: look at how the existing
   `SignatureHash()` function is called._

2. `SignatureHashSchnorr()` is passed a `PrecomputedTransactionData*` argument.
   What data is stored in this structure? Why?

3. `SignatureHashSchnorr()` is passed a `hash_type` argument. How many valid
   hash types are there? The `hash_type` parameter is split into `output_type`
   and `input_type` here:

     ```
     // Hash type
     const uint8_t output_type = ...
     const uint8_t input_type = ...
     ```

     How many valid values are there for `output_type` and `input_type`?

4. Just like `SignatureHash()`, the new function creates a local `CHashWriter`
   object. `CHashWriter` is a stream-like object. Other objects can be
   serialized into it (using the `<<` operator), and at the end,
   `CHashWriter::GetHash()` is called to retrieve the digest.

     One difference from `SignatureHash()` is that the `CHashWriter` is
     copy-constructed from `HasherTapSighash`. How is _that_ object constructed, and
     what's the difference from a regular `CHashWriter` object?

5. If the `hash_type` does not have the `ANYONECANPAY` flag, certain parts of
   the transaction are added to the `CHashWriter`. What are those elements, and
   how is that different from `SignatureHash()`?

6. A `spend_type` byte is added the `CHashWriter`. What are the component parts
   of `spend_type`, and what do they indicate? _Hint: refer back to BIP 341 and
   BIP 342._

7. If the `hash_type` indicates `SIGHASH_SINGLE`, there's a check here:

     `if (in_pos >= tx_to.vout.size()) return false;`

     What is that testing, and why?
