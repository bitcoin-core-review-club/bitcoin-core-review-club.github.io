## Notes

- A few weeks ago, [we looked at](/17860.html) how fuzzing can find consensus bugs, such as money printing (brrrr). This
  week we will use fuzzing to find a remote crasher.

- [BIP 37](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0037.mediawiki) describes a way to filter transaction relay
  by bloom filters. For the purposes of this pull request we will only need to know the different message types it
  introduces and how the Bitcoin Core node processes them.

- [CVE-2013-5700](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures#CVE-2013-5700) was a vulnerability
  that could crash a node by merely sending two P2P messages.

- There is [documentation on how to compile with AFL and libFuzzer on
  Linux](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/fuzzing.md). Other fuzz engines might work, but are
  currently undocumented.

- [CNode](https://doxygen.bitcoincore.org/class_c_node.html) is the data structure to represent a connection in Bitcoin
  Core.

- [CConnman](https://doxygen.bitcoincore.org/class_c_connman.html#aacdbb7148575a31bb33bc345e2bf22a9) is the connection
  manager in Bitcoin Core. A thread to handle messages from connections is created at startup. See
  [`ThreadMessageHandler`](https://doxygen.bitcoincore.org/class_c_connman.html#aacdbb7148575a31bb33bc345e2bf22a9).

## Questions

1. Did you review the PRs? [Concept ACK, approach ACK, tested ACK, or
   NACK?](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#peer-review)
   (Don't forget to put your PR review on GitHub.)

2. How would a remote node crash a Bitcoin Core node that is vulnerable to the attack? What are the steps it needs to
   take and what messages would it send?

3. How was the vulnerability fixed?

4. Where in `CNode` are bloom filters for transaction relay filtering stored?

5. Where are bloom filter messages handled by Bitcoin Core?

6. Based on the previous questions, how would a fuzz test for Bitcoin Core exploit this vulnerability? What are the
   steps needed on a high level to achieve this setup?

7. What patch need to be applied on current Bitcoin Core to reintroduce the vulnerability?

8. Did you get fuzzing to run on your machine? If not, what issues did you run into?

8. Did you find the crash?
