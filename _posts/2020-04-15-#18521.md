## Notes

- A few weeks ago, [we looked at](/17860.html) how fuzzing can find consensus bugs, such as money printing (brrrÌ…). This
  week we will use fuzzing to find a remote crasher.

- [BIP 37](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0037.mediawiki) describes a way to filter transaction relay
  by bloom filters. For the purposes of this pull request we will only need to know the different message types it
  introduces and how the Bitcoin Core node processes them.

- [CVE-2013-5700](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures#CVE-2013-5700) was a vulnerability
  that could crash a node by merely sending two P2P messages.

- Bitcoin core has [documentation on how to compile with AFL and libFuzzer on
  Linux](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/fuzzing.md). Other fuzz engines and operating systems might
  work, but are currently undocumented.

- [CNode](https://doxygen.bitcoincore.org/class_c_node.html) is the data structure to represent a connection in Bitcoin
  Core.

- [CConnman](https://doxygen.bitcoincore.org/class_c_connman.html) is the connection manager in Bitcoin Core. A thread
  to handle messages from connections is created at startup. This is often referred to as the "main" thread in Bitcoin
  Core, taking care of message processing and validation. See
  [ThreadMessageHandler](https://doxygen.bitcoincore.org/class_c_connman.html#aacdbb7148575a31bb33bc345e2bf22a9).

- The pull request we are looking at this week is extending CConnman for testing purposes with several features:

  * Adding and removing nodes directly (without having to create a socket)
  * Push a serialized message onto a nodes' receive buffer

- The fuzz test itself does mainly two things for each fuzz input or fuzz seed:

  * Add a random amount of test nodes (the number of nodes is read from the fuzz input)
  * Pick a random peer and send some random bytes as a message from this peer, i.e. put the bytes into the receive
    buffer of this peer
  * Repeat the last step

## Questions

1. Did you review the PRs? [Concept ACK, approach ACK, tested ACK, or
   NACK?](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#peer-review)
   (Don't forget to put your PR review on GitHub.)

2. How would a remote node crash a Bitcoin Core node that is vulnerable to the attack? What steps would it need to take
   and what messages would it send?

3. How was the vulnerability fixed?

4. Where in `CNode` are bloom filters for transaction relay filtering stored?

5. Where are bloom filter messages handled by Bitcoin Core?

6. Based on the previous questions, how would a fuzz test for Bitcoin Core exploit this vulnerability? What are the
   steps needed on a high level to achieve this setup?

7. What patch needs to be applied to current Bitcoin Core to reintroduce the vulnerability?

8. Did you get fuzzing to run on your machine? If not, what issues did you run into?

9. Did you find the crash?
