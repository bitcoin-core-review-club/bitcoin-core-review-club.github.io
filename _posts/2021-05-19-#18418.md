## Notes

* The way our wallet constructs transactions over time can leak information
  about its contents.  The most obvious example is we can assume that all UTXOs
sent to the same scriptPubKey are controlled by the same person. UTXOs sent to
different addresses may also be linked if they are spent together (a common
heuristic used in chain analysis).  Thus, if we're not careful, observant
attackers can link addresses to estimate our wallet balance and, if any one of
our addresses is deanonymized (e.g. we send it to an exchange, merchant, or
block explorer that knows our personal information or IP address), we might
accidentally reveal how much money we have!

* The Bitcoin Core wallet implements a few best-practice privacy techniques.
  One is avoiding the reuse of addresses when creating an invoice or change
address.  Another is grouping UTXOs into
[OutputGroup](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/blob/4ac1adda9914d845aaea5804af4801ffec53c701/src/wallet/coinselection.h#L72)s
by scriptPubKey and running coin selection on the groups rather than individual
UTXOs.

* However, `OutputGroup`s can grow quite large - after all, anyone can send as
  many transactions as they want to an address that we've published. It might
not make sense to fund a 0.015BTC transaction by sweeping a group of 150 inputs
worth 10BTC (not to mention the extra fees for all the unnecessary inputs).
The `OUTPUT_GROUP_MAX_ENTRIES` constant limits the number of UTXOs per
`OutputGroup`.

	- Within `GroupOutputs()`, if we have more than
	  `OUTPUT_GROUP_MAX_ENTRIES` with the same scriptPubKey, we batch them
into multiple `OutputGroup`s with up to `OUTPUT_GROUP_MAX_ENTRIES` UTXOs each.
	- If we are avoiding "partial spends," we won't include non-full
	  `OutputGroup`s in coin selection.

* [PR#18418](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18418) increases
  `OUTPUT_GROUP_MAX_ENTRIES` from 10 to 100. The number 100 was suggested
during a [previous review club](https://bitcoincore.reviews/17824.html#l-339).
This behavior change constitutes just one line (and some adjustments to the
tests), but it is ripe with opportunities to explore how coin selection works.

* Try adding some log statements, re-compiling and then re-running the tests
  (Hint: `test/functional/combine_logs.py` to see logs, and you can assert that
your logs are printed by adding `with
node.assert_debug_log(expected_msg=[your_log_statement])` to the functional
test).

	- Some good tests to play around with are wallet\_avoidreuse.py and
	  wallet\_groups.py.
	- The PR author, fjahr, has written an excellent [guide to
debugging Bitcoin Core](https://github.com/fjahr/debugging_bitcoin) with some
hints on adding logging and using debuggers.
	- You can also tinker with some of the constants (maybe poke around for
	  off-by-one errors) and see if things break!

* You may find some previous review clubs helpful:

	- Review Club [#17824](/17824) discussed the `avoid_reuse` flag.
	- Review Clubs [#17331](/17331) and [#17526](/17526) discussed coin
	  selection.


## Questions

1. Did you review the PR? [Concept ACK, approach ACK, tested ACK, or
NACK](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#peer-review)?
What was your review approach?

2. What do the `avoid_reuse` wallet flag and `-avoidpartialspends` wallet
options do?  Which of the following combinations are possible / make sense?

	(A) `avoid_reuse = true, avoidpartialspends = true`

	(B) `avoid_reuse = true, avoidpartialspends = false`

	(C) `avoid_reuse = false, avoidpartialspends = true`

	(D) `avoid_reuse = false, avoidpartialspends = false`


3. If your wallet has 101 UTXOs of 0.01 BTC each, all sent to the same
scriptPubKey, and tries to send a payment of 0.005 BTC, avoiding partial
spends, how many inputs will the resulting transaction have (Hint: this is
almost exactly the `test_full_destination_group_is_preferred` test case in
wallet\_avoidreuse.py).

4. In that test case, what is the fee amount paid for the 0.5BTC transaction?
(Hint: try `import pdb; pdb.set_trace()` and call the
[gettransaction](https://developer.bitcoin.org/reference/rpc/gettransaction.html)
RPC).

5. Can you have multiple UTXOs under the same address if you set
`avoid_reuse=true`?

6. What are the advantages, disadvantages, and potential risks to users of
increasing `OUTPUT_GROUP_MAX_ENTRIES`?

7. What do you think of increasing `OUTPUT_GROUP_MAX_ENTRIES` to 100,
specifically?

8. For the purpose of coin selection, what's the difference between
`m_avoid_partial_spends` and `m_include_partial_groups` in
`CoinEligibilityFilter` (Hint: `m_avoid_partial_spends` becomes
`separate_coins` in `GroupOutputs()`)?
