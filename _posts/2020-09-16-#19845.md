## Notes

### Motivation

- Today's PR 19845 is part of [PR
  19031](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19031), a proposed
  implementation of the
  [BIP155](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/9286b5254317d9e73fb25c5f0acd2b2d9937843e/bip-0155.mediawiki)
  `addrv2` message.

- `addrv2` is a new p2p message format proposed in early 2019 by Wladimir J. van
  der Laan to support networks that have longer endpoint addresses than fit in
  the 128 bits/16 bytes of the current `addr` message.

- [Issue 18884 "Tor v3
  support"](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/18884) is the meta-issue
  for tracking overall progress on BIP155 and its implementation.

- This work is urgent because Tor v2 was deprecated yesterday (September 15,
  2020) with 0.4.4.x and will be obsoleted in 0.4.6.x (July 15, 2021). Tor v2 is
  expected to be completely disabled in Tor client stable versions on October
  15, 2021 as [announced
  here](https://blog.torproject.org/v2-deprecation-timeline): "From today (July
  2nd, 2020), the Internet has around 16 months to migrate from onion services
  v2 to v3 once and for all."

- Why is Tor v2 EOL? According to [this Tor mailing list
  post](https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2020-June/014365.html):
  "To very quickly summarize why we are deprecating, in one word: Safety. Onion
  service v2 uses RSA1024 and 80 bit SHA1 (truncated) addresses. It also still
  uses the TAP handshake which has been entirely removed from Tor for many years
  now _except_ v2 services. Its simplistic directory system exposes it to a
  variety of enumeration and location-prediction attacks that give HSDir relays
  too much power to enumerate or even block v2 services. Finally, v2 services
  are not being developed nor maintained anymore. Only the most severe security
  issues are being addressed."

- A [previous review club meeting discussing the parent PR 19031](/19031)
  provides more background and context.

### Network address types newly recognized by PR 19845

  - [Next-generation Tor v3 Onion
  addresses](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/NextGenOnions) -
    "Better crypto (replaced SHA1/DH/RSA1024 with SHA3/ed25519/curve25519),
    improved directory protocol leaking much less information to directory
    servers, a smaller surface for targeted attacks, better onion address
    security against impersonation, and a more extensible introduction/rendezvous
    protocol."

  - [Invisible Internet Project (I2P)](https://geti2p.net) - "The I2P network
    provides strong privacy protections for communication over the
    Internet. Many activities that would risk your privacy on the public
    Internet can be conducted anonymously inside I2P."

  - [Cjdns](https://github.com/cjdelisle/cjdns) - "Cjdns implements an encrypted
    IPv6 network using public-key cryptography for address allocation and a
    distributed hash table for routing. This provides near-zero-configuration
    networking, and prevents many of the security and scalability issues that
    plague existing networks."

  - With PR 19845, you can make peer connections to these network address types
    by using the `addnode` RPC or the `-addnode` / `-connect` configuration
    options. Here's how:
      - `./src/bitcoin-cli help addnode`
      - `./src/bitcoind -h | grep -A4 "\-addnode=\|\-connect="`

   - For *rumouring* these address types, more is needed. For instance, PR
    19954---the remaining step of 19031---enables running bitcoind as a Tor v3
    service.

### Technical Notes

- Today's PR 19845 adds the ability to serialize and deserialize internet
  addresses in `addrv2` format. It also adds Tor v3 address parsing and builds
  on just-merged [PR 19841](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19841),
  "Implement Keccak and SHA3_256". The latter is needed for Tor v3 support, as
  the conversion from BIP155 encoding to .onion notation uses an SHA3-based
  checksum.

- The `addrv2` feature is enabled by OR-ing an integer flag, `ADDRV2_FORMAT`
  ([code](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19845/files#diff-76d15e11a95be7a4aee1eb89de6098caR32)),
  into the stream version.

- The PR makes use of the custom `Span` type, which was introduced into Bitcoin
  Core in [PR 12886](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12886) and
  represents a vector-like view to a range of contiguous elements in memory
  analogous to `std::span` in C++20. If you are not familiar with `Span`, it was
  discussed in a [recent review club meeting](/18468).

- Tor v3 address parsing should follow [this
  spec](https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/tree/rend-spec-v3.txt#n2135),
  which is also summarized
  [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/9286b5254317d9e73fb25c5f0acd2b2d9937843e/bip-0155.mediawiki#appendix-b-tor-v3-address-encoding)
  in the BIP.

## Questions

1. Warm-up question #1: Visually, how can you tell the difference between a Tor
   v2 and v3 address?

2. Warm-up question #2: List all the network address types that Bitcoin Core
   can support after this PR. What is the size in bytes (address length) for
   each of them? What is the maximum address length Bitcoin Core will be able to
   support?

3. Warm-up question #3: Is `addrv2` deserialization faster or slower than v1? By
   roughly how much?

4. Did you review the PR? Bonus: Did anyone also review [PR
   19841](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19841), "Implement Keccak and
   SHA3_256"?

5. What steps did you take to review this PR? Did you review on GitHub, or in
   your local dev environment? Did you review commit-by-commit, or the whole
   diff? What did you review first: the code, the tests, or
   [BIP155](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/9286b5254317d9e73fb25c5f0acd2b2d9937843e/bip-0155.mediawiki)?
   Did you verify that the code corresponds to the spec for each network address
   type? Any thoughts on the test coverage?  Do you see anything that is not tested or
   could also be tested?

6. When should the new `sendaddrv2` message type, aka "send me addrv2", be sent?

7. What does this implementation do if an unknown or non-validateable network
   address type is encountered? How about a known network with wrong length? Are
   these considered misbehavior? Discouraged? Not relayed? Ignored? Why?

8. What is meant by "variable-length addresses" in BIP155 and when referring to
   `addrv2`?

9. How will the new address formats be saved in `peers.dat`, which currently
   persists addresses in 16-byte IPv6 format?

10. Why was the boolean `pad` parameter added to `EncodeBase32()`?

11. How do you think Bitcoin Core should make the transition from Tor v2 to v3?
    All at once, or v3 first opt-in, then default (and v2 opt-in or deprecated)?
    In which releases?
