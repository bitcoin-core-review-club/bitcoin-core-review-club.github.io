## Notes

The UTXO cache is a critical datastructure in Bitcoin for both correctness and
performance. It's responsible for maintaining a view of the spendable coins
based upon the transactions in blocks. It is often a major bottleneck during
block validation, and incorrect behavior is almost certain to lead to consensus
failure.

Because the UTXO set is accessed so frequently, we would like its contents
available as quickly as possible. This amounts to having as much of the set
in memory as possible. The issue is that (at the moment) the in-memory
representation of the UTXO set is more than 8GB, and obviously not all hosts
running Bitcoin have that much memory. 

For that reason, the UTXO cache [is stratified across several
layers](https://jameso.be/dev++2018/#54): some on-disk, and some in-memory. The
`-dbcache` parameter controls how much memory we allocate to the in-memory
portion. As we validate blocks, we pull unspent coins that we look up from disk
into memory until we run out of allocated memory (as indicated by [this
logic](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/28fbe68fdcac2a06f359b1e48555a3d23015c2b7/src/validation.cpp#L2198-L2220)).

At that point, we completely empty the UTXO cache by writing it to disk by
calling
[`CCoinsViewCache::Flush()`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/28fbe68fdcac2a06f359b1e48555a3d23015c2b7/src/coins.cpp#L205-L210).
In master, this is the only way of reconciling the state of the cache
with the leveldb store on disk, even though sometimes we Flush() not because we
have exceeded our dbcache, but to ensure durability. For example, we
[periodically
flush](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/28fbe68fdcac2a06f359b1e48555a3d23015c2b7/src/validation.cpp#L2275-L2276)
the coins cache to avoid having to replay blocks if we shutdown improperly.

Once we flush the cache, we are forced to read from and write to disk
for all UTXO operations, which can be notably slower depending on the
underlying disk. For this reason, separating the emptying of the cache
from the writing to disk might allow us to ensure durability without losing the
performance benefits of maintaining the cache.

A year ago, @andrewtoth
[proposed](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15218) that we flush the
UTXO set after the completion of initial block download to avoid having to
reconstruct the entire set if an unclean shutdown happened before a periodic
flush, which basically amounts to a `-reindex-chainstate`. Other reviewers
criticized this idea because of the performance implications of emptying the
cache.

Another case that requires writing to disk without necessarily emptying the
cache can be found in the [assumeutxo
project](https://github.com/jamesob/assumeutxo-docs/tree/master/proposal). When
loading a UTXO set from a serialized snapshot, it's preferable to write out the
newly constructed chainstate immediately after load to avoid having to reload
the snapshot once again after a bad shutdown. [Benchmarks have
shown](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17487#issuecomment-561741590)
that some platforms benefit significantly from maintaining the contents of the
cache after writing them to disk.

## Questions

- Did you review the PR? [Concept ACK, approach ACK, ACK \<commit\>, or
  NACK?](https://github.com/jonatack/bitcoin-development/blob/master/how-to-review-bitcoin-core-prs.md#peer-review)&nbsp;
  Don't forget to put your PR review on GitHub or [ask
  questions](https://github.com/jonatack/bitcoin-development/blob/master/how-to-review-bitcoin-core-prs.md#ask-questions).

- What is the "shape" of the UTXO set? What is it keyed and valued by? What are
  the operations it supports? Hint: try looking at
  [`coins.h`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/coins.h).

- What are the different layers of the UTXO cache? 
  - How does `CCoinsView` relate to `CCoinsViewCache` and CCoinsViewDB`?
  - How does `CCoinsViewDB` relate to `DBWrapper`?
 
- What do the flags associated with `CCoinsCacheEntry` objects mean?
  - What does `DIRTY` mean?
  - What does `FRESH` mean?
  - Why do we go to the trouble of maintaining these flags?

- What happens when `CCoinsViewCache::Flush()` is called? How do the coins
  in memory make their way to the disk?
 
- When an unspent coin is flushed to disk and then spent in the next block, we
  will have done (at least) two writes and a read for that coin. If a coin is
  created and spent without a Flush() in between, no disk reads or writes are
  done. Why is this? 

- Can you describe the consensus bug referenced
  [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17487#issuecomment-557595582)?

- Are you able to describe how
  [`ccoins_cache_simulation_test`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/b12c4b092de159a38342fb7069cd1903bf5ce680/src/test/coins_tests.cpp#L102-L111) works?
  - This test has a lot randomness. How do we ensure full coverage?
  - How does this test compare to [the one I've
    added](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17487/commits/eebaca7620bbd0af0ec385c6c7d47b2b4b524d55)?

- Do you understand the
  [benchmarks](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17487#issuecomment-557226923)
  that are given as justification for this PR? 
  - Given the sensitivity and complexity of the UTXO cache, how should we think
    about the trade-offs of supporting this kind of operation?
