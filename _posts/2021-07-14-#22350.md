title: "Rotate the debug log file"
pr: 22350

commit: ea728a306
---

This week, we'll look at [PR 22350](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22350)
that proposes to rotate the `debug.log` file on disk. Four weeks ago, we reviewed
[PR 21603](https://bitcoincore.reviews/21603); this PR is an alternative.

This time we're going to try something different -- LarryRuane will host a video chat
at [https://meet.jit.si/bitcoin-core-pr-reviews-22350](https://meet.jit.si/bitcoin-core-pr-reviews-22350)
and all are invited to join!  We'll also use IRC as usual (we'll see how this
goes).

The purpose of the video meeting is that Larry will share his display and show how
one might use the `gdb` debugger as an aid to reviewing this or any PR. The session
will be recorded, and the link to the recording sent out with the IRC log after
the meeting.

Bitcoin Core developer Fabian Jahr has provided an excellent
[document](https://github.com/fjahr/debugging_bitcoin) and
[video](https://youtu.be/6aPSCDAiqVI) on using the system debugger and much
more. Larry will more narrowly focus on using `gdb` effectively.

## Notes

- Please review to the Notes for the [PR 21603 review](https://bitcoincore.reviews/21603)
  for background information about logging.

- Many operating systems solve the logging growth problem by automatically _rotating_ their
  system logs; run `ls /var/log` on any Linux system and you'll likely see several different
  kinds of log files with numbers as part of their filenames;
  these are "rotated" log files -- older versions of the main log file. Some of these
  are also compressed.

- Linux and other Unix-like systems include a tool specialized to this exact task,
  `logrotate`. It's usually configured to run periodically (daily, for example) using
  the built-in `cron` facility.

- The `logrotate` command is difficult to configure (run `man logrotate`),
  knowledge of `cron` is also required, and is not available on Windows or on some
  stripped-down Linux distributions.

- For that reason, some programs do their own internal log rotation.
  The concept is, when a log file reaches a certain size, the system that "owns" the log
  file renames it to an alternate name (usually by including a sequence number), and resets
  the main log file to empty.
  Usually this occurs as a side-effect of writing a log message.

- Different things can be done with the rotated log files. For example:

  - Retain only a configurable number of the most recent log files, deleting older files.
  - Compress and save the rotated log files for a configurable time period.
  - Upload the log files to a remote system that can archive them (store them cheaply).

- Many commercial data storage systems do internal
  log file rotation (examples [here](https://docs.netapp.com/sgws-110/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.netapp.doc.sg-troubleshooting%2FGUID-6B06B7DD-E6B0-415F-8B36-B32734FBE8E4.html)
  and [here](https://docs.datafabric.hpe.com/62/AdministratorGuide/LogCollection_Rotation.html)).

- While Bitcoin Core's `debug.log` file grows without limit for as long as `bitcoind`
  runs, it does do one kind of trimming: When `bitcoind` starts up, it checks the
  length of `debug.log`; if it's greater than 11 MB, it
  [shrinks it](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/8ab0c77299a5b184a8d0edf38f26a97bf9bbed6e/src/logging.cpp#L306)
  down to the most recent 10 MB of logging data.

## Questions

1. Did you review the PR? [Concept ACK, approach ACK, tested ACK, or
   NACK](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#peer-review)?
   What was your review approach?

1. Why does `bitcoind` include the concept of a log file? It uses disk space; what's
   the advantage? Have you needed to look at `debug.log`; has it been useful?

1. What's the connection with denial-of-service attacks?

1. If we receive an invalid transaction, why don't we log that this happened?
   Should we?

1. [PR 21603](https://bitcoincore.reviews/21603) uses a different approach,
   log rate limiting. (Quick summary: Parts of the code that are generating too
   much logging too quickly are throttled; not all their log messages are saved,
   although this limiting itself is logged so readers of the log are aware that
   it's happened.) What are the advantages and disadvantages of these two
   approaches? Which do you think would result in more useful log output?

1. Other log rotation systems append a sequence number to rotated logs (for example,
   on Linux systems, in `/var/log`, you see `syslog.1`, `syslog.2`, ... This PR
   names the rotated log files by date, such as `debug-2021-06-27T21:19:42Z.log`.
   What are the trade-offs? Which naming style do you prefer?

1. Should this PR also compress rotated log files?

1. Is this PR even necessary, given that the `logrotate` facility exists? What
   are the trade-offs?

1. On Linux systems, `logrotate` is located in `/usr/sbin`. What kinds of programs
   are stored there, as opposed to the more standard `/usr/bin`?
