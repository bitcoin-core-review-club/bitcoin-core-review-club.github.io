## Notes
    
- Following an accidental chain split in 2013 (documented in [BIP
  50](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/7e3284da/bip-0050.mediawiki)), a
  fork warning system was added in [PR
  2658](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2658).

- The feature was originally tested via the large reorg test (today found
  in `test/functional/feature_block.py`). However it is no longer possible to
  trigger the warning due to changes in the validation logic.

- The validation logic to validate and potentially connect a new block is
  handled in `ProcessNewBlock()`, which can be called from `ProcessMessage()`
  in net_processing, or the `submitblock` RPC. `ProcessNewBlock()` runs basic
  validation sanity checks and stores the block to disk. If the initial checks
  pass, it calls `ActivateBestChain()` to (try to) connect the block to the
  best chain.

## Questions

1. Did you review the PRs? [Concept ACK, approach ACK, ACK, or
   NACK?](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#peer-review).

2. What are some examples of when a chain split can happen? Which ones should
   users be warned about?

3. `ActivateBestChain()` consists of two nested loops. What is the condition for
   each loop to terminate?

4. The inner loop calls `ActivateBestChainStep()`, which disconnects blocks (in
   case of a reorg) and connects a batch of up to 32 blocks toward the new tip.
   When an invalid block is found, `CheckForkWarningConditionsOnNewFork()` is
   called. Which block from the batch is passed to
   `CheckForkWarningConditionsOnNewFork()`?

5. `ActivateBestChainStep()` will also call `m_chain.SetTip()`, which updates the
   global reference to the active chain tip (`::ChainActive().Tip()`). What is
   the maximum block height difference between `pindexNewForkTip` and `pfork`?

6. Is it possible to hit the condition that updates `pindexBestForkTip`?

7. What are your thoughts on the approach of the pull request? Should the bug
   in the warning system be fixed or should the code be removed? What
   alternative places/ways to implement the warning logic can you think of?
