## Notes

- The mempool keeps a set of [_unbroadcast_
  transactions](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/0844084c13af36c45a0e4fc49fc0c6c0d9513406/src/txmempool.h#L586)
containing the txids of transactions that have not passed initial broadcast yet (determined based on
a heuristic, whether or not the node
has received a `getdata` for it). The unbroadcast set was introduced in PR #18038, which we covered
in a [previous review club](/18038).

- The node rebroadcasts transactions in two different routines (triggered by the scheduler):
  [`PeerManagerImpl::ReattemptInitialBroadcast()`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/0844084c13af36c45a0e4fc49fc0c6c0d9513406/src/net_processing.cpp#L1099)
rebroadcasts transactions in the unbroadcast set directly through
`PeerManagerImpl::_RelayTransaction()` and
[`CWallet::ResendWalletTransactions()`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/0844084c13af36c45a0e4fc49fc0c6c0d9513406/src/wallet/wallet.cpp#L1745)
re-submits its own transactions to the node via `BroadcastTransaction()`.

- Transactions can be referred to by txid (without witness) or wtxid (with witness, defined in
  [BIP141](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0141.mediawiki#specification)).  Multiple
valid transactions can have the same non-witness data (same txid) but different witnesses (different
wtxid). Nodes relay transactions by both txid and wtxid (since PR #18044, which we also covered in a
[previous review club](/18044)).

- There are two unexpected behaviors in
  [`BroadcastTransaction()`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/0844084c13af36c45a0e4fc49fc0c6c0d9513406/src/node/transaction.cpp#L29):
one is related to unbroadcast and the other is in wtxid-based transaction relay.

	- Unbroadcast: If `BroadcastTransaction()` is called with a transaction that has the same
	  txid as a transaction in the mempool (can be same witness, different witness or even
invalid witness), it causes the transaction to be re-added to the unbroadcast set.

	- Relay: If `BroadcastTransaction()` is called with a same-txid-different-wtxid transaction
	  as something already in the mempool, it will call `RelayTransaction()` with the wtxid of
the argument tx's wtxid rather than the one in the mempool. This causes the relay to fail (`INV`s
are not sent) for WTXID relay peers because `SendMessages()` queries the mempool by wtxid, doesn't
find it, and drops the announcement.


## Questions

1. Did you review the PR? [Concept ACK, approach ACK, tested ACK, or
NACK](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#peer-review)?  What was your
review approach?

2. How is `BroadcastTransaction()` invoked (i.e. what code paths)?

3. What happens when `PeerManager::RelayTransaction()` is called with the wtxid of a transaction
that isn't in the mempool?

4. What does the unbroadcast set represent, conceptually? When should a transaction be added and
removed from the unbroadcast set?

5. In what scenario would the mempool have a transaction with the same txid but different wtxid as a
wallet transaction (feel free to give creative answers)?

6. What bugs are present prior to this PR? Can you think of a scenario in which they cause a privacy
leak?

7. How does PR #22261 fix these bugs?

8. Bonus: Why does the unbroadcast set contain txids instead of wtxids?
