In this PR Review Club meeting, we'll discuss [BIP
330](https://github.com/naumenkogs/bips/blob/bip_0330_updates/bip-0330.mediawiki) and the
high-level concepts behind Erlay.

We'll also look at the first few net processing commits in more detail:

- [Announce reconciliation support](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/commit/6103b5cdcec775c77ac47b550bfc0b979d53b051)
- [Handle reconciliation support announcement](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/commit/34a485e0f1c9511fbd18cc6c0d60b6ca8929ccd9)
- [Limit transaction flooding](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/commit/aff98fcc1e83615b9bdff4a240898d15231d5f94)
- [Remove node from reconciliation queue when disconnecting](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/commit/f24c51e452ef3f7562e44422abd7b3162b0b13c8)

## Notes

-  Erlay is a proposal for a new method of transaction relay based on a
  combination of flooding and reconciliation (the current transaction relay is
  flooding-only).  The idea was presented in a [2019
  Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.10518) and is described in
  [BIP-330](https://github.com/naumenkogs/bips/blob/bip_0330_updates/bip-0330.mediawiki).

- Reconciliations work asymmetrically in Erlay, depending on the direction of
  the connection: When we interact with an outbound peer (i.e. we connected to
  them), we are the requestor of a reconciliation, and our peer is the responder
  (vice versa when interacting with an inbound peer).

- In the simplest scenario being a requestor means that we send a
  reconciliation (message REQRECONCIL), get an answer back (SKETCH), reply with
  the reconciliation differences (RECONCILDIFF) that we can extract by comparing
  our sketch with the received one.  At this point, both parties know which
  transaction their peers might require and which are known to both.

- A sketch is a representation of a set of transactions (or their short-IDs)
  which is optimized for required space. Erlay implements the existing set
  reconciliation algorithm PinSketch.

- Erlay does not completely abandon flooding but uses it much more sparingly.
  Nodes will still flood certain transactions to a limited number of peers -
  the goal is that only well-connected publicly reachable nodes flood
  transactions to other publicly reachable nodes via outbound connections.

## Questions

1. Did you review the PR? [Concept ACK, approach ACK, tested ACK, or
   NACK](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#peer-review)?

2. What advantages does a reconciliation-based approach to transaction relay
   have over the current flooding method. What are the trade-offs?

3. Which of the existing message types participating in transaction relay will
   be sent less with Erlay? Which will be unaffected?

4. Can you explain _why_ a reconciliation-approach scales better than flooding?
   (after all, the reconciliation messages also consume regular traffic)

5. How do two peers reach agreement about whether to use reconciliation?

6. If two peers have agreed to use reconciliations, does that mean there will
   be no flooding on this connection?

7. In [commit
   aff98f](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18261/commits/aff98fcc1e83615b9bdff4a240898d15231d5f94),
   MAX_OUTBOUND_FLOOD_TO is set to 8. Considering that 8 is also the maximum
   number of outbound connections participating in tx relay, what do you think is
   the motivation behind this?

8. Can you think of possible new attack vectors that would specifically apply
   to Erlay?
