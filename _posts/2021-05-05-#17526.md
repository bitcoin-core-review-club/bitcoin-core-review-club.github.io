## Notes

* **Coin selection** refers to the process of selecting UTXOs (or "coins") from a wallet's available
  UTXO pool to fund a transaction. Generally, the goal is to pick coins that will minimize
fees for the user (now and in the long run), help the transaction reliably
confirm in a timely manner, and not leak information about the wallet. [This
Stack Exchange
post](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/32145/what-are-the-trade-offs-between-the-different-algorithms-for-deciding-which-utxo/32445#32445)
offers an overview of tradeoffs between different coin selection strategies. We
covered coin selection in a previous review club,
[#17331](/17331).

* [PR #17526](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17526) implements Single Random Draw (SRD) as
  an additional fallback coin selection strategy. SRD is fairly straightforward: it
randomly picks `OutputGroup`s from a pool of eligible UTXOs until the total amount is sufficient to
cover the payment and fees. Any extra funds are put in a change output.

* This means that, with this PR, our coin selection will have three different
  solvers: Branch and Bound (BnB), Knapsack, and Single Random Draw (SRD). Note
that some randomness is used in coin selection, so we won't always come up with
the same solution.

* The overall strategy within
  [SelectCoins()](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/blob/4ac1adda9914d845aaea5804af4801ffec53c701/src/wallet/wallet.cpp#L2424)
(including PR #17331, on which PR #17526 is built):

	- Coins manually selected by the user using `CoinControl` are added first.

	- All available coins (excluding the pre-selected ones) are gathered.
	  `CoinEligibilityFilter`s are used to filter these coins within `SelectCoinsMinConf()`.
 We have a clear hierarchy of which coin selection solutions are preferred: we first try with a
restriction of at least 6 confirmations on foreign UTXOs and 1 confirmation on our own UTXOs.
If no solution is found, we try with at least 1 confirmation on all UTXOs. If that doesn't work and
the user allows spending unconfirmed change, we try that (still requiring at least 1 confirmation on
foreign UTXOs), gradually increasing mempool ancestor limits on the unconfirmed change.

	- Within
	  [SelectCoinsMinConf()](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/blob/4ac1adda9914d845aaea5804af4801ffec53c701/src/wallet/wallet.cpp#L2395),
`OutputGroup`s are created using the `CoinEligibilityFilter`. There is a clear
preference for BnB and we will only try Knapsack and SRD if that fails.
However, we'll try both Knapsack and SRD together, picking the solution with
lower fees, breaking ties by number of UTXOs used.


## Questions

1. Can you give a high-level description of the coin selection strategy
   including the changes proposed in this PR?

2. Within `SelectCoinsMinConf()`, if we have both a Knapsack and an SRD
   solution, how do we decide which one to use?

3. Why might we prefer to spend more inputs in the same transaction?

4. Quiz: Based on the coin selection scheme proposed here, let's say that Solutions A, B, and C
   exist (ignore the fact that we would exit early after finding a solution we're satisfied with). Which would we pick?
(Hint: which invocation of `SelectCoinsMinConf()` would each of these come from?)

	 Solution A: picked using Knapsack. Produces a change output, pays 100 satoshis in fees, and
only uses confirmed UTXOs, each with 4 confirmations.

	Solution B: picked using BnB. No change output, pays 95 satoshis in fees, and uses one
unconfirmed change output.

	Solution C: picked using SRD. Produces a change output, pays 99 satoshis in fees, and only uses
confirmed UTXOs, each with 1 confirmation.


5. What are
   [OutputGroups](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/blob/4ac1adda9914d845aaea5804af4801ffec53c701/src/wallet/coinselection.h#L72)?
Why does SRD pick from output groups rather than from UTXOs?

6. What does calling `GroupOutputs()` with `positive_only=true` do (Hint: you may
   want to review what effective values are)? What could happen if
`SelectCoinsSRD()` was called with `all_groups` instead of `positive_groups`?

7. What are some ways a deterministic coin selection algorithm might leak
   information about the wallet's UTXO pool? Why do we
[shuffle](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/2b45cf0bcdb3d2c1de46899e30885c953b57b475/src/wallet/wallet.cpp#L2503)
`vCoins` before creating `OutputGroup`s?

8. Bonus: We've listed some qualitative (e.g. presence of a change output) and quantitative (e.g. number of inputs used) ways to
compare coin selection solutions. Instead of returning as soon as `SelectCoinsMinConf()` finds a
solution, should we try multiple and then pick one? How might we design a metric
to decide which one to use?
