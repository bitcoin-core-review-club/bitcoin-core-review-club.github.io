## Notes

- The `reindex` command wipes and rebuilds the two leveldb databases for the
  block index and the chainstate, using the block files saved on disk. This
  procedure is completely local and requires no interactions with the p2p
  network. For help on the command see `bitcoind -help | grep -A1 reindex`.

- Reindexing is a lengthy procedure taking several hours on mainnet and
  consists of two steps:

    1. Rebuilding the index of blocks based on the `blk*.dat` files saved in
       `.bitcoin/blocks`.

    2. Rebuilding the chainstate (UTXO set) by fully validating each block
       starting from genesis using the block index created in step 1.

- There is a second command, `reindex-chainstate` that will only perform step 2.
  This PR improves the runtime of step 1 and does not affect step 2 (which
  is already highly optimized since it uses the same validation functions that
  are used for connecting new blocks received from the network).

- Reindex uses the `CBufferedFile` stream, introduced in
  [#1962](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1962), which has a buffer to
  allow "rewinding" the stream position to an earlier position without additional
  disk access. In the merged PR
  [#16577](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16577) the author of this
  week's PR fixed a bug in  `CBufferedFile` and added comprehensive unit tests.

- The reindexing happens in `LoadExternalBlockFile()` (validation), which is
  called for each block file. The block index is rebuilt by calling
  `AcceptBlock()` for each block in the chain in correct order.

- However, blocks are usually not saved to disk in the correct order during IBD
  (listen to Pieter Wuille's recent [Chaincode
  podcast](https://podcast.chaincode.com/2020/01/27/pieter-wuille-1.html) for
  more background, starting at 3:30). Therefore, the parent hash of blocks that
  are encountered without a known predecessor is saved in the map
  `mapBlocksUnknownParent`. After accepting a block, the reindex algorithm
  recursively accept all blocks from `mapBlocksUnknownParent` which are ready for
  processing now and removes them from the map.

- Before this PR, we would always read entire blocks from disk into our buffer.
  If the predecessor of a block was not available, the blocks would have be
  read again at a later point. This PR changes behavior such that initially only
  the 80 byte block header is read into the buffer, and if we can't accept the
  block yet, the rest of the block is skipped for now.

- Earlier versions of this PR had a different scope, also changing the size of
  the buffer. The discussion prior to [this
  comment](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16981#issuecomment-589791783)
  by the author is therefore no longer relevant for the PR in its current form.

## Questions

1. Did you review the PR? [Concept ACK, approach ACK, tested ACK, or
NACK?](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#peer-review)
(Don't forget to put your PR review on GitHub.)

2. In which situations is `reindex` useful? When is it better to use
   `reindex-chainstate`?

3. What does the block index database look like? What information is stored
   there?

4. Can you explain why this PR reduces the runtime of reindexing considerably?

5. How good is the test coverage of the reindexing (functional and unit tests)?
   Do you think it can be improved?

6. Can you think of further optimizations of reindexing beyond this PR that are
   possible/worthwhile?
