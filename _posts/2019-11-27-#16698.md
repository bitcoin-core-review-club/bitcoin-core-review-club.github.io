## Notes

- Previously, a node would only rebroadcast a transaction if it is the originating
  wallet, which is very bad for privacy. These changes propose
  extracting the rebroadcast logic from the wallet into the mempool and having all nodes
  rebroadcast a set of transactions it thinks _should have been mined_ by now.

- _Should have been mined_ is a tricky concept to define. At a high
  level, this implementation determines what _should have been mined_ as follows:
  1. Every ~20 mins, run a fee rate cache that computes the top of the mempool
     and stores the min package fee rate for a transaction to be included.
  2. Rebroadcast events are triggered by a random [poisson timer](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/03f6f408ab2e9b30e1ee747b76bd9edc20b2c99d/src/net.h#L994).
     When the timer pops, check if there has been a new block since the cache
     last ran. If there hasn't been a new block, just bump the timers to try and hit
     those conditions in the next run.  If the conditions have been met this round,
     continue with the rebroadcast logic
  3. Calculate the set of transactions that are at the top of the mempool and >30 mins old.
  4. Filter out any transactions with fee rate < cached fee rate.
  5. Rebroadcast the remaining set.

- To minimize rebroadcast noise, we want the order of events to be ->
  cache run | block | rebroadcast. If we run the cache and then rebroadcast
  (without a block in between), the cache is not as meaningful. Thus we store
  the block height & compare to chain tip before rebroadcasting.

- With these changes, the division of responsibility between the wallet & the
  node (mempool) are as follows:
  - The wallet ensures the (local) mempool knows about the transaction by periodically
    attempting to resubmit that transaction.
  - The mempool applies rebroadcast logic to ensure that the network knows
    about any transactions it believes should have already been mined.

- This new logic could result in a problem: if a transaction is submitted locally
  and not immediately relayed, it could take a long time to be included in the
  rebroadcast set (for example, if its a low fee rate transaction), and thus a long
  time until it's first seen on the network. To mitigate this, the mempool keeps
  track of transactions submitted locally via `m_unbroadcast_txids`. When it's
  time to rebroadcast, any unbroadcast transactions will be added to the set to
  relay. A transaction is removed from this set when a peer requests is via a
  `GETDATA` message.

- Reviewer notes: A good place to get started is by reading the commit messages.
  A great way to add value would be to think through or observe the
  interactions between the different mechanisms introduced.

## Questions

1. Did you review the PR? [Concept ACK, approach ACK, tested ACK, or
   NACK?](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#peer-review)
   (Don't forget to put your PR review on GitHub.)

2. Did you take any steps beyond reading the code?

3. This PR claims to improve privacy. Do you agree? What are privacy leaks that
   would remain after these changes? Can you describe the attack vectors?

4. What are some of the tradeoffs / costs incurred in this implementation?

5. What mechanisms prevent extreme bandwidth spikes on the network?
    * Why is the cache less meaningful if theres no block between cache &
      rebroadcast?
    * How does the cache interact with the recency filter to reduce rebroadcast
      set?

6. How are the functional tests? What is not tested? What are other ways of
   testing these changes?
