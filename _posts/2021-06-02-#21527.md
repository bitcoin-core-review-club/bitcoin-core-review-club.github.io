## Notes

- [PR 21527](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21527) continues the work
  of better encapsulating net_processing that ajtowns has been tracking in [WIP
  PR 20758](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/20758).

- The previous PR in the series ([PR
  21148](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21148)) moved most of the
  orphan processing logic out of net_processing into its own subcomponent,
  [txorphanage](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/8115c2ad7/src/txorphanage.cpp).
  Splitting self-contained units of logic into their own classes/translation
  units makes it easier to test that logic in isolation. Enforcing a well-defined
  interface to the component also makes it easier to reason about how
  the code will behave.

- This PR does two things:

  - introduces an `m_mutex_message_handling` mutex in `PeerManager`, which guards data
    that is used in `PeerManager`'s message handling. Doing that allows us to remove
    the `cs_sendProcessing` mutex from net.

  - removes the `g_cs_orphans` mutex from net_processing and adds an internal
    mutex to `TxOrphanage`, making it responsible for its own locking and thread
    safety.

## Questions

1. Did you review the PR? [Concept ACK, approach ACK, tested ACK, or
   NACK](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#peer-review)?
   What was your review approach?

2. Does this PR change observable behaviour of the node in any way?

3. What was the `cs_sendProcessing` mutex responsible for before this PR? When
   was `cs_sendProcessing` introduced? (Hint use `git blame` and `git log -S
   "string"` to search back through previous commits).

4. This PR moves one mutex from net to net_processing
   (`CNode.cs_sendProcessing` is replaced by
   `PeerManager.m_mutex_message_handler`) and one mutex from net_processing to
   txorphanage (`g_cs_orphans` is replaced by `TxOrphanage.m_mutex`). What are
   the benefits of moving these global/externally visible mutexes to being defined
   internally in their respective classes?

5. What are `vExtraTxnForCompact` and `vExtraTxnForCompactIt`? Why is it ok to
   stop guarding them with `g_cs_orphans` and guard them with
   `m_mutex_message_handling` instead?

6. This PR removes the `Peer.m_orphan_work_set` member and replaces it with
   a `m_peer_work_set` map in `TxOrphanage`. What is the peer orphan work set
   used for?

7. (Bonus question) This PR originally included some behavioural changes in the
   way that orphans are handled. Those have now been moved from this PR to
   [a separate branch](https://github.com/ajtowns/bitcoin/commits/202104-whohandlesorphans)
   and may be proposed as a follow-up PR. What are those behaviour changes?
