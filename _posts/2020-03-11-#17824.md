## Notes

This PR is a partial fix to a bug report from last November: [partial spend avoidance makes partial spends and getbalances doesn't notice #17603](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/17603).
Contributor dooglus describes two ways in which the Bitcoin Core wallet does not
behave as expected when using the `avoid_reuse` wallet flag (Sidenote: The issue is a great example
of how bugs should ideally be reported, including details steps to reproduce the issue
on `regtest`). The fix is rather small but there is a lot to dig into around
`avoid_reuse`, coin selection and if this is the best solution for the problem.

The `avoid_reuse` wallet flag was introduced in [#13756](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13756)
with a follow-up in [#16239](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16239)
by kallewoof to mitigate the damage of [dust attacks](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/81508/deanonymizing-dust-attack/81509#81509).
It achieves this by both avoiding to spend from destinations that the wallet has
previously spent from and also tries to sweep larger parts of the outputs in
a destination when it does spend from a destination that has multiple outputs
available. The issue adressed by this PR is concerning the latter part
of `avoid_reuse`. The main keyword to look out for in the code is `GroupOutputs`.

The other error reported in [#17603](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/17603)
was a misrepresentation of the wallet balances in the RPC `getbalances` which was fixed
in [#17843](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17843).

## Questions

1. Did you review the PR? [Concept ACK, approach ACK, tested ACK, or
NACK?](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#peer-review)
(Don't forget to put your PR review on GitHub.)

2. This PR touches the broad topic of coin selection. Coin selection changes seem to
have a hard time getting reviews. Why do you think that is? What are some bad things
that can happen if something goes wrong in coin selection?

3. What is the problem with coin reuse? How can it be exploited and how did
the `avoid_reuse` feature approach solving it? Are you aware of other approaches
to mitigate attacks, maybe implemented by other privacy-focussed wallets?

4. Can you describe the problem this PR tries to solve in your own words, including
the necessary preconditions?

5. What is the approach of the current version of the PR to fix the issue?

6. How does the current approach compare to [the previously proposed approach](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17824#issuecomment-569928051)
by the author? Can you think of other (better?) ways to solve it?

7. More broadly speaking, how do you like the current approach of how `avoid_reuse`
handles this case of coin selection. Can you think of different solutions to the
problem?
