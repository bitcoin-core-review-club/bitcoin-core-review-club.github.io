## Notes

* [PR 15644](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15644) was merged
  over a year ago. It changes the way a node looks through its orphan
  set to figure out if orphans can now be processed and added to the
  mempool.

* A transaction is an _orphan_ if we're missing one or more of its inputs (we
  refer to the transactions that create the transaction outputs spent by the
  orphan as _parent_ transactions). This might be a valid transaction, but we
  don't know yet. We have to be careful with orphan management because orphans
  cannot be validated.

* Orphans are stored in a map called `mapOrphanTransactions` by their
  txid. We limit the number of orphan transactions to
  [`-maxorphantx`](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/blob/pr15644/src/net_processing.h#L17)
  which is by default 100.

## Questions

1. Did you review the PR? [Concept ACK, approach ACK, tested ACK, or
   NACK](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#peer-review)?
   You're always encouraged to put your PR review on GitHub, even after it has
   been merged.

2. Why might we want a node to keep track of orphans at all? What does
   this help with?

3. Look at the way orphans are added to the orphan maps and how
   orphans are re-evaluated when we accept new transactions to the
   mempool. What happens when a node receives a transaction where it
   has not seen the transaction's inputs?

4. Observe that
   [`mapOrphanTransactionsByPrev`](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/blob/pr15644/src/net_processing.cpp#L188)
   is a map of outpoints to a set of *iterators* over the orphan transactions map.
   Why do you think it's written the way it is, instead of storing, say, orphan
   txids?

5. Can you think of a problem with the pre-PR version of the code?
   What is it and how does the PR fix it? Hint: look at what we are
   iterating over when processing orphans pre- and post- PR.

6. How might the adoption of something like [`SIGHASH_NOINPUT`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0118.mediawiki) affect orphan processing?
