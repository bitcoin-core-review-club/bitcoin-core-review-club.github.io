In this Review Club we will dive into how blocks are downloaded and stored on
disk, how disk access is arranged and a bug it has caused.

## Notes

### Concepts

- When a node first connects to the network, it does an [_Initial Block
  Download (IBD)_](https://bitcoin.org/en/glossary/initial-block-download) to
  download all the blocks to the tip, validate them and connect them in its block
  chain.

- [_Block undo
  data_](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/895c71e53557ce0385181191270c660fc6c32ce1/src/undo.h#L62-L69)
  is all the information that is necessary to revert a block if the block needs
  to be disconnected during a reorg.

- The blocks database is represented by two instances of
  [`FlatFileSeq`](https://doxygen.bitcoincore.org/class_flat_file_seq.html) -
  one for all `blocks/blk*.dat` files and another one for all `blocks/rev*.dat`
  files. [`FlatFilePos`](https://doxygen.bitcoincore.org/struct_flat_file_pos.html)
  is used to locate objects within those files.

- The meta information about a single block file and its corresponding undo
  file is represented by
  [`CBlockFileInfo`](https://doxygen.bitcoincore.org/class_c_block_file_info.html).

- The [`fflush` library call](https://linux.die.net/man/3/fflush) moves all
  buffered data from the `FILE*` buffers to the OS (i.e. in kernel buffers). It
  may not necessary hit the disk yet.

- The  [`fsync` system call](https://linux.die.net/man/2/fsync) moves all
  modified data from the OS buffers to the disk.

### Block and undo files

- Blocks are stored in a custom format in the `blocks` directory. This
  directory consists of a series of `blk*.dat` files (currently 128 MiB each)
  that contain the raw blocks.

- Each block is written to disk as it arrives from the network. Because blocks
  are downloaded in parallel from more than one peer during initial block
  download this means that a block with greater height can be received (and
  written to disk) before a block with lower height. We call these out-of-order
  blocks.

- When initial block download finishes things calm down and new blocks arrive
  every 10 minutes on average (assuming the node is online to receive them).
  That means we're much less likely to write blocks out of order.

- In addition to the `blk*.dat` files, we also generate and store "undo"
  information for each block in corresponding `rev*.dat` files. This can be used to
  revert all the transactions from the block if we need to disconnect the block
  from the chain during a reorg. Unlike blocks, this information is always stored
  in block height order.

- We put block and undo data in corresponding `blk*.dat` and `rev*.dat` files,
  but internally they may be in different order. For example, the undos for all
  blocks in `blk1234.dat` will be in `rev1234.dat`, but maybe the block at height
  100 is somewhere near the beginning of `blk1234.dat` whereas its undo is
  somewhere near the end of `rev1234.dat`.

## Questions

### Overview

- Can we
  [create](https://doxygen.bitcoincore.org/validation_8cpp_source.html#l02164)
  an undo file for a given block without having all prior blocks?

- Do we ever modify existing data in the blocks database, or do we just append
  new blocks and their undos?

### Dive

- How is space allocated in the files when new data is appended? Why?

- What does it mean to "finalize" a file?

- What is the bug that the PR is fixing?

- How would you reproduce the bug or show it exists?

- How is the bug being fixed in the PR?

### Aftermath

- What can be improved further in this area?
