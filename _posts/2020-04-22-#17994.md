## Notes

In this Review Club we will dive into how blocks are downloaded and stored on disk. How disk access is arranged and a bug it has caused.

The blocks are stored in a custom database stored in the `blocks/` directory. It consists of a series of `blk*.dat` files (currently 128 MiB each) that contain the raw blocks. Each block is written to the database as it arrives from the network. Because blocks are downloaded in parallel from more than one peer during initial block download this means that a block with bigger height can be received (and thus written to disk) before a block with smaller height. We call these out-of-order blocks. When initial block download finishes things calm down and we most likely do not have any more out-of-order blocks because a new block arrives every 10 minutes (if the node is constantly online to receive them).

In addition to the blocks stored in `blk*.dat`, we also generate and store "undo" information for each block in corresponding `rev*.dat` files. This is used to revert all the transactions from the block, should we decide to disconnect it from the chain. Unlike blocks, however, this information is always stored in block height order.

It follows that we put block and undo data in corresponding `blk*.dat` and `rev*.dat` files, but internally they may be in different order. For example, the undos for all blocks in `blk1234.dat` will be in `rev1234.dat`, but maybe the block at height 100 is somewhere near the beginning of `blk1234.dat` whereas its undo is somewhere near the end of `rev1234.dat`.

### Concepts

- [Initial Block Download](https://bitcoin.org/en/glossary/initial-block-download)

- "block undo" - all the information that is necessary to revert a block, if a chain reorganization happens, for example.

- The blocks database is represented by two instances of [class FlatFileSeq](https://doxygen.bitcoincore.org/class_flat_file_seq.html) - one for all `blocks/blk*.dat` files and another one for all `blocks/rev*.dat` files. [struct FlatFilePos](https://doxygen.bitcoincore.org/struct_flat_file_pos.html) is used to locate objects within those files.

- The meta information about a single block file + its corresponding undo file is represented by [class CBlockFileInfo](https://doxygen.bitcoincore.org/class_c_block_file_info.html).

- file [flush](https://linux.die.net/man/3/fflush) - moving all buffered data from the `FILE*` buffers to the OS (i.e. in kernel buffers). It may not necessary hit the disk yet.

- file [fsync](https://linux.die.net/man/2/fsync) - moving all modified data from the OS buffers to the disk.

## Questions

### Overview

- Can we [create](https://doxygen.bitcoincore.org/validation_8cpp_source.html#l02164) an undo for a given block without having all prior blocks?
- Do we ever modify existing data in the blocks database, or do we just append new blocks and their undos?

### Dive

- How is space allocated in the files when new data is appended? Why?
- What does it mean to "finalize" a file?
- What is the bug that the PR is fixing?
- How would you reproduce the bug or show it exists?
- How is the bug being fixed in the PR?

### Aftermath

- What can be improved further in this area?
