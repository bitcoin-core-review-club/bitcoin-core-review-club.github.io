## Notes
    
- This is a draft PR which removes the `g_chainman` global variable and
  `::Chain{,state}Active()` functions in favor of having callers either use or
  obtain local references to the relevant consensus-related object
  (`ChainstateManager`, `CChainState`, `CChain`, `BlockManager`, etc.).

- Prior to this PR, there were numerous references to the `g_chainman` global
  variable and `::Chain{,state}Active()` functions, some of them even in
  contexts where a local `ChainstateManager` reference existed.

- This PR is a first step towards encapsulating our consensus engine, which
  allows for:

  - Clearer visibility into what currently lies in consensus codepaths **and**
  what depends on our consensus engine

  - Coalescing duplicate consensus initialization codepaths, mitigating
    against bugs that arise out of test/non-test initialization
    inconsistencies

- Some historical context can be gleaned from:

  - The introduction of `CChainState` in [PR 10279](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10279)

  - The introduction of `BlockManager` in [PR 16194](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16194)

  - The introduction of `ChainstateManager` in [PR 17737](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17737)

  - The addition of the `chainman` pointer to `NodeContext` in [PR 18698](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18698)

## Questions

1. Did you review the PRs? [Concept ACK, approach ACK, ACK, or
   NACK?](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#peer-review).

2. How did the PRs linked in the historical context notes change the
   organization of `validation.cpp`? What kind of state/logic now belongs in
   each consensus-related object (`ChainstateManager`, `CChainState`,
   `BlockManager`)?

3. Where and how are the aforementioned consensus-related objects initialized?

4. What are the advantages and disadvantages of using global variables and
   functions?

5. Why are the first few fix commits in the branch necessary? Why does the
   previous code work prior to de-globalizing `g_chainman` and why doesn't it
   work now without the fix?
