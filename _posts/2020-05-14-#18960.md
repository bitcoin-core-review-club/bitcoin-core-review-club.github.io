This is the second special Bitcoin Core PR Review Club looking at the [BIP 157
implementation](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18876). Today, we'll
look at the second PR in the series: _Add compact block filter headers cache_.

## Notes

- [BIP 157](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0157.mediawiki)
  defines [checkpoints](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0157.mediawiki#cfcheckpt), which are compact block filter headers at 1000 block
  intervals. Newly syncing clients can fetch the checkpoints first (potentially
  from a trusted source) and then fill in the intermediate filter headers, and
  finally the filters themselves. Because the filter headers form a hash chain,
  the client can verify that they've been provided with the correct filters and
  headers by checking against the checkpoints.

- Since the checkpoint filter headers are the potentially the most frequently
  served data, it makes sense to cache them in memory rather than read them
  from disk every time.

- I've taken a different approach from jimpo's original implementation, so in
  this review club, we'll take a look at three different approaches:

  1. [The original implementation](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/commit/af3bddfbdfb7de06d6e63a0a425da483c435521a),
     which added an [`active_chain_cf_headers`](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/commit/af3bddfbdfb7de06d6e63a0a425da483c435521a#diff-eff7adeaec73a769788bb78858815c91R409)
     vector in net_processing to cache the block filter headers, and updated that cache in
     the [`UpdatedBlockTip()`](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/commit/af3bddfbdfb7de06d6e63a0a425da483c435521a#diff-eff7adeaec73a769788bb78858815c91R1325) callback.

  2. [A second implementation](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/commit/d71f982b81599626ca0ed2f0b27fab23030c21df),
     which uses the same `active_chain_cf_headers`, but updates it in the
     [`ProcessGetCFCheckPt()`](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/commit/d71f982b81599626ca0ed2f0b27fab23030c21df#diff-eff7adeaec73a769788bb78858815c91R2093)
     function.

  3. [A third implementation](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/commit/7ad83ed252914d6d5b8ed81f103aecf052c68fb7),
     which moves the cache into the [`BlockFilterIndex`](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/commit/7ad83ed252914d6d5b8ed81f103aecf052c68fb7#diff-cd54aeb5dc34c03025454c52c47fd493R37)
     class, and doesn't change net processing logic.

## Questions

- Why is a lock added in the first and second implementations? Is it also needed
  in the third implementation?

- The first implementation could cause a [data race on
  shutdown](https://travis-ci.org/github/bitcoin/bitcoin/jobs/665594933#L5705)
  ([full log](/assets/txt/18960_1_log.txt)). Can you find where the data race is?

- What are the main differences between the implementations? Which approach do
  you prefer?
