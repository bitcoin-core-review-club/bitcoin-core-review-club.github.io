## Notes

- The `BanMan` class manages [two related but distinct concepts](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/86a8b35f/src/banman.h#L27):

  1. Banning: Manually configured by the user via the `setban` RPC method. No
     outbound/inbound connections will be established with a banned address or
     subnet and the address will not be gossiped. Banned addresses are persisted in
     `banlist.dat` on shutdown and reloaded on startup.

  2. Discouragement: Peers are assigned a [misbehavior
     score](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/86a8b35f/src/net_processing.cpp#L1018)
     for sending us messages that violate the protocol (e.g. a too large
     payload, or headers that don't connect to our chain). If a peer accumulates a
     misbehavior score of 100, we disconnect and _discourage_ that address.  Inbound
     connections from discouraged addresses are allowed but preferred for eviction.
     Outbound connections are not made to discouraged addresses, and those addresses
     are not gossiped. Discouraged addresses are not persisted to disk on shutdown.

- Neither banning nor discouragement fully protect against a determined
  attacker, since IP addresses are inexpensive.

- If implemented without care, automatic banning would increase the risk of a
  network split.

- The `BanMan` interface allows banning and unbanning via `CNetAddr` and
  `CSubNet`. This PR consolidates to only accept `CSubNet` (an IP address is a
  subnet of 1).

- This PR also adds two new RPC commands:

  1. `setban listbanned ip`: lists all the ban entries that include `ip`

  2. `setban removeall ip`: removes all ban entries that include `ip`

## Questions

1.  What are some use cases for banning specific IP addresses or subnets?

2.  Is automatic banning/disconnection an effective DoS countermeasure for
    misbehaving peers?

3.  How can automatic banning/disconnection be abused by an attacker?

4.  Would well-formed `setban ip add`/`setban ip remove` RPC calls ever throw an
    error? Should they?

5.  On master, what happens if you try to ban the same IP address twice? How does
    this affect the UX for ban scripts?

6.  Before this PR, if `setban 192.168.1.1/24 add` is followed by `setban
    192.168.1.1 add`, an error is thrown. However you can `setban 192.168.1.1/32
    add`. Why does this happen?

7.  Are there any downsides to allowing overlapping ban entries as this PR does?

8.  How can the user figure out which ban entries might be blocking outbound
    connections to a certain IP (before and after this PR)?

9.  How can the user completely unban an IP (before and after this PR)?
