## Notes

- `BanMan` has two functions:
    1. Banning: Manually configured by the user via the `setban` rpc. No
       outbound/inbound connections will be established with a banned address or
       subnet; their address will not be gossiped. Banned addresses are
       persisted in `banlist.dat` on shutdown and reloaded on startup.
    2. Discouragement: [Misbehaving
       peers](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/86a8b35f/src/net_processing.cpp#L1018)
       are discouraged over time. Inbound connections to discouraged peers are
       allowed but preferred for eviction. Outbound connections are not made and
       their addresses are not gossiped.

- Neither banning nor discouragement protect against DoS attacks as IP
  addresses are inexpensive.

- Programatic banning or disconnection increase the risk of a network split.

- The `BanMan` interface allows banning and unbanning via `CNetAddr` and
  `CSubNet`. This PR consolidates to only accept `CSubNet` (an IP address is a
  subnet of 1).

- This PR also adds two new RPC commands:
    1. `setban listbanned ip`: lists all the ban entries that include `ip`
    2. `setban removeall ip`: removes all ban entries that include `ip`

## Questions

1.  What are some use cases for banning specific IP addresses or subnets?

2.  Is programatic banning/disconnection an effective DoS countermeasure for
    misbehaving peers?

3.  How can programatic banning/disconnection be abused by an attacker?

4.  Would well-formed `setban ip add`/`setban ip remove` RPC calls ever throw an
    error? Should they?

5.  On master, what happens if you try to ban the same IP address twice? How does
    this affect the UX for ban scripts?

6.  Before this PR, if `setban 192.168.1.1/24 add` is followed by `setban
    192.168.1.1 add`, an error is thrown. However you can `setban 192.168.1.1/32
    add`. Why does this happen?

7.  Are there any downsides to allowing overlapping ban entries as this PR does?

8.  How can the user figure out which ban entries might be blocking outbound
    connections to a certain IP (before and after this PR)?

9.  How can the user completely unban an IP (before and after this PR)?

10. Is `std::optional<T>`(used
    [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19825/commits/e650bba6fd9bd399ad67a13758189652888bdf04#diff-e9917b4358a3dcbaf2aeb188578d64d7036d45bdccbb5d6daff3f9a5927c6620R156))
    a valid type when `T` is a reference type? How is it different from
    `boost:optional<T>`?

11. In `src/test/fuzz/banman.cpp`, why do we use
    `fuzzed_data_provider.ConsumeIntegralInRange<int>(0, 11)` instead of
    generating a random integer?
